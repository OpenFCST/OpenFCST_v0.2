In order to obtain a polarization curve, the `main.xml` file needs to be modified as follows

    1. Go to section ``Simulator`` and set the variable ``Analysis type`` to ``Polarization Curve``
    
    2. In section `Polarization Curve` setup the initial and final voltage and the increment between points.

An example `main.prm` file is given below:
