\section{About OpenFCST}

The open-source Fuel Cell Simulation Toolbox (OpenFCST) is an open-source mathematical modelling package for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. OpenFCST has been developed as a modular toolbox from which you can develop your own applications. It contains a database of physical phenomena equations, fuel cell layers and materials, and mathematical models for reaction kinetics. In addition, it already contains several applications that allow you to simulate different fuel cell components. For example, you can simulate a cathode electrode (using either a macrohomogeneous or an ionomer-filled agglomerate model), an anode electrode or a complete membrane electrode assembly. The applications already provided in OpenFCST have been validated with respect to experimental data in the literature \cite{Dobson12} as well as numerical results from other models implemented in a commercial package~\cite{Secanell07}. A thorough description of the model and validation is presented in \cite{Secanell07}.

OpenFCST is being developed at the \htmladdnormallink{Energy Systems Design Laboratory}{http://secanell-srv01.mece.ualberta.ca/} at the University of Alberta in collaboration with the \htmladdnormallink{Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp.}{http://www.afcc-auto.com} that, together with the \htmladdnormallink{Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada}{www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca}, has provided the majority of the funding required to develop this code. The goal of OpenFCST is that research groups in academia and in industry use the current toolbox to better understand fuel cells and to develop new physics and material databases that can then be integrated in the current library.

OpenFCST is an integrated open-source tool for fuel cell analysis and design. It seamlessly integrates several open-source pre-processing, finite element, and post-processing tools in order to analyze fuel cell systems. OpenFCST contains a built-in mesh generator. If your problem requires you to simulate more complex geometries, it can also import quadrilateral meshes generated with the open-source pre-processor \htmladdnormallink{Salome}{http://www.salome-platform.org/} and exported in UNV format. The physics and material database in OpenFCST allows you to setup the governing equations for the most important physical processes that take place in a fuel cell. OpenFCST already implements the weak form for many governing equations. They are solved using the finite element open-source library \htmladdnormallink{deal.II}{http://www.dealii.org/}. OpenFCST builds on top of the \htmladdnormallink{deal.II}{http://www.dealii.org/} finite element libraries and many of its software requirements and coding philosophy is inherited from deal.II. In order to analyze your results, OpenFCST can output your results to .vtu files that can easily be read with the open-source post-processor \htmladdnormallink{Paraview}{http://www.paraview.org/}. OpenFCST is also integrated with the design and optimization package \htmladdnormallink{Dakota}{http://dakota.sandia.gov/software.html}. Therefore, it can be used for design and optimization as well as parameter estimation~\cite{Secanell07,Secanell07b,Secanell08,Dobson12}.

OpenFCST is under development. If you like the library and would like to contribute towards the development, you can help the developers in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
 \item If you are an industrial researcher that is considering using OpenFCST for research and development in the company, please contact the developers in order to develop a research program with them. 
 \item If you are either an industrial or academic researcher using the library, please make sure to cite the OpenFCST libraries in your publications. Please cite any relevant publication by the OpenFCST developers as well as the current reference \cite{Secanell13} and introduction paper \cite{Secanell14}.
 \item If you are either an industrial or academic researcher using the library and you have developed a new physics model or material database entry, please consider submitting it to the developers so that it can be integrated with the newest version of OpenFCST.
 \item If you are an industrial researcher considering using OpenFCST for research and development in the company, please consider hiring the graduate students that develop OpenFCST, i.e. the graduate   students from the \htmladdnormallink{Energy Systems Design Laboratory}{http://secanell-srv01.mece.ualberta.ca/?q=people} at the University of Alberta.
\end{itemize}

Currently, the developers are working on:
\begin{itemize}
 \item improving the code readability – new classes are being developed for making the code easier to understand and more modular;
 \item developing a convective gas and liquid transport model for the electrodes;
 \item developing a Navier-Stokes solver for gas transport in the fuel cell channels.
\end{itemize}

\section{About the Developers}

OpenFCST was originally conceived by M. Secanell in 2006 while doing his Ph.D. at the University of Victoria~\cite{Secanell07}. In 2004, M. Secanell developed a small set of routines that were used to setup the governing equations for a fuel cell cathode in two dimensions. The governing equations were first linearized and then the weak form of the equations was implemented and solved using the \htmladdnormallink{deal.II}{http://www.dealii.org/} finite element libraries \cite{Secanell07b}. In 2006, after attending a deal.II workshop in Heidelberg, Germany, and discussing the idea of creating an open-source code for fuel cells based on deal.II with Dr. Guido Kanschat and Dr. Wolfgang Bangerth, M. Secanell decided to integrate the routines he had developed into AppFrame, an application framework developed by Dr. Guido Kanschat, thereby initiating the development of a toolbox that could be used to create modules or applications for fuel cell analysis. From 2006 to 2008, OpenFCST development continued with the implementation of a complete membrane electrode assembly model; however, with M. Secanell as a sole developer, the code was too rough and disorganized to result in an open-source fuel cell package that the research community could use. In 2009, once M. Secanell joined the University of Alberta, the idea of developing OpenFCST was solidified. Thanks to the funding provided by the \htmladdnormallink{Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp.}{http://www.afcc-auto.com/}, \htmladdnormallink{MITACS}{http://www.mitacs.ca/} and the \htmladdnormallink{Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada}{http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca}, a group of core developers was established at the \htmladdnormallink{Energy Systems Design Laboratory}{http://secanell-srv01.mece.ualberta.ca/} at the University of Alberta. The current research team re-developed the majority of the classes in order to increase the modularity, usability and reliability of the code. Currently, OpenFCST is used by 6-8 researchers at two different laboratories, it is 
tested nightly for errors and it contains a bug tracking site to report any issues with its performance.
