Various necessary R and D efforts that will accelerate the commercialization of PEFCs in automotive applications are also discussed. The current PEFC membranes of choice are based on poly[perfluorosulfonic acid] (PFSA), and are produced by DuPont, Asahi Glass, and 3M. Low RH conductivity at operating temperatures should be improved and more stable catalyst supports should be developed that improve corrosion resistance at high potentials. (38 refs},

@article{Madhu06,
	Abstract = {Ultra-low pure Pt-based electrodes (0.04-0.12 mgPt/cm2) were prepared by dual ion-beam assisted deposition (dual IBAD) method on the surface of a non-catalyzed gas diffusion layer (GDL) substrate. Film thicknesses ranged between 250 and 750 A, these are compared with a control, a conventional Pt/C (1.0 mgPt(MEA)/cm2, E-TEK). The IBAD electrode constituted a significantly different morphology, where low density Pt deposits (largely amorphous) were formed with varying depths of penetration into the gas diffusion layer, exhibiting a gradual change towards increasing crystalline character (from 250 to 750 A). Mass specific power density of 0.297 gPt/kW is reported with 250 A IBAD deposit (0.04 mgPt/cm2 for a total MEA loading of 0.08 mgPt/cm2) at 0.65 V. This is contrasted with the commercial MEA with a loading of 1 mgPt(MEA)/cm2 where mass specific power density obtained was 1.18 gPt/kW (at 0.65 V), a value typical of current state of the art commercial electrodes containing Pt/C. The principal shortcoming in this effort is the area specific power density which was in the range of 0.27-0.43 W/cm2 (for 250-750 A IBAD) at 0.65 V, hence much below the automotive target value of 0.8-0.9 W/cm2 (at 0.65 V). An attempt to mitigate these losses is reported with the use of patterning. In this context a series of patterns ranging from 45 to 80% Pt coverage were used in conjunction with a hexagonal hole geometry. Up to 30% lowering of mass transport losses were realized. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (48 refs.)},

	Abstract = {Efforts in developing various models for PEM fuel cells have been increasing in recent years, and thus creating an urgent need for systematic experimental data on fuel cells with commercially available components. Such systematic experimental data is also needed by new fuel cell developers to accelerate their system development and optimization. To meet these needs, we present in this paper systematic experimental data on the performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell with interdigitated flow fields. The experiments concentrate on the effects of cell temperature, gas humidification, cell operating pressure and reactant gas flow rate. The experimental results are presented in the form of polarization curves. In addition, a three-dimensional fuel cell mathematical model is used to simulate the cell performancewith the interdigitated flow fields.

	Abstract = {The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics of a high-surface-area carbon-supported platinum catalyst (Pt/C) were measured in an operating proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The ORR kinetics of Pt/C can be described over a wide range of temperature, pressure, and current density using four catalyst-specific parameters: transfer coefficient, exchange current density, reaction order with respect to oxygen partial pressure, and activation energy. These parameters were extracted using a combined kinetic and thermodynamic model, either referenced to the reversible cell potential (i.e., using exchange current density as activity parameter) or referenced to a constant ohmic-resistance-corrected (i.e., iR-free) cell voltage. The latter has the advantage of using an activity parameter (activity at 0.9  V iR-free cell voltage) which can be measured explicitly without extrapolation, in contrast to the exchange current density required in the former model. It was found that much of the variation in the published values for these catalyst-specific kinetic parameters derives from applying the same parameter name (e.g., activation energy) without specifying which of its many possible definitions is being used. The obviously significant numerical differences both for "oxygen reaction order" and for "activation energy" due to different definitions (often tacitly assumed and rarely explicitly stated in the literature) are illustrated by the kinetic ORR parameters which we determined for Pt/C: (i) at zero overpotential, where reaction order and activation energy are ~0.5 and 67  kJ/mol, respectively, and (ii) at 0.9  V iR-free cell voltage, where reaction order and activation energy are ~0.75 and 10  kJ/mol, respectively.},

	Abstract = {A knowledge of the temperature dependence of the electrode-kinetic parameters for oxygen reduction at the platinum/proton exchange membrane (PEM) interface and of mass-transport parameters of oxygen in the PEM is of vital importancein analyzing the performance of proton exchange-membrane fuel cells. The microelectrode technique which was previouslydeveloped to determine these parameters at the platinum/Nafion{\textregistered} interface at 25$\,^{\circ}$C was used in the present investigationat the same electrode/electrolyte interface. This study was carried out in the temperature range of 30--80$\,^{\circ}$C and at 5 atm ofoxygen pressure. The results showed a linear increase of the Tafel slope with temperature in the low current density region,but the Tafel slope was found to be independent of temperature in the high current density region. The values of theactivation energy for oxygen reduction at the platinum/Nafion{\textregistered} interface are nearly the same as those obtained at theplatinum/trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TFMSA) interface but less than values obtained at the Pt/H3PO4 and Pt/HClO4interfaces. The diffusion coefficient of oxygen in Nafion increases with temperature while its solubility decreases withtemperature. These parameters also depend on the water content of the membrane. The conductivity of the membraneincreases with temperature until it reaches a plateau at a temperature of 80$\,^{\circ}$C; the dependence of the conductivity ontemperature was correlated with the variation of water content of Nafion with temperature.},

Investigations of this type have been conducted in ourlaboratories using a microelectrode technique. In these studies, pseudosteady-state voltammetry and electrochemicalimpedance spectroscopy were used to determine the oxygen reduction kinetics at ambient conditions as well as at elevatedtemperatures. This study focuses on the dependence of the oxygen reduction kinetics on oxygen pressure. ConventionalTafel analysis of the data shows that the reaction order with respect to oxygen is unity at both high and low currentdensities. Chronoamperometric measurements of the transport parameters for oxygen in Nafion show that oxygen dissolutionfollows Henry's isotherm. The diffusion coefficient of oxygen is invariant with pressure; however, the diffusioncoefficient for oxygen is lower when air is used as the equilibrating gas as compared to when oxygen is used for equilibration.These results are of value in understanding the influence of O2 partial pressure on the performance of PEM fuel cellsand also in elucidating the mechanism of oxygen reduction at the platinum/Nafion interface.},

	Abstract = {The effect of air flow rate, fuel and oxidant gas stream humidity, and cell operating temperature on the spatial and temporal current density distribution was investigated in a single gas channel PEM fuel cell using a segmented electrode/current collector assembly. Related studies on oxygen operation and fuel starvation effects are presented in part one of this paper. The current density distribution was found to be a strong function of the available oxygen concentration down the channel that was determined by the air supply rate. Higher flow rates reduced the drop in the current density profile along the channel. At lower air flow rates, a simultaneous increase in cell temperature and anode humidification level resulted in increasing segment performance near the inlet accompanied by a related decrease in the current densities downstream. Further increasing the air flow rate ultimately led to enhanced reaction rates over the entire length of the channel. If cell temperature elevation were not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the anode humidification level, the dehydration pattern on the anode side tended to dominate the local current density distribution. Beyond a certain point the current density distribution along the channel was exclusively dependent on oxidant availability and gas diffusion rates and thus neither higher anode humidification nor cell temperature elevation had a significant influence at the chosen operating segment potential. {\copyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2005},

	Abstract = {A segmented electrode/current collector setup was used to examine the effect of oxygen flow rate, anode sparger temperature, and hydrogen starvation on the spatial and temporal distribution of local current densities along a single gas channel in a PEM fuel cell operated on pure hydrogen and oxygen. Uniformity in local current densities at a given voltage was sustained over longer periods of time with higher oxygen flow rates that enhanced liquid water removal. When water removal rate was not sufficient, electrode flooding occurred in segments that were farthest from the gas inlet. Increasing anode sparger temperature resulted in reduction of water removal rate from the cathode by back diffusion leading to performance reduction of downstream segments. When fuel was in excess, the current density distribution was dominated by the hydration pattern of the membrane electrode assembly. When fuel supply was less than the electrochemical reaction demand, segments furthest from the inlet suffered fuel starvation, resulting in loss of performance. The use of one of the electrode segments as a novel in-line voltage sensor to reflect available reactant concentrations was also demonstrated. Air operation and effect of cell temperature were also examined and the results are presented in the second part of this series. {\copyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2005},

	Annote = {Current density and potential distribution measurements were conducted using a segmented current collector and flow field setup on membrane electrode assemblies prepared with segmented and unsegmented electrodes made from two different types of commercially available gas diffusion layers. Both galvanostatic and potentiostatic discharge modes were employed. Irrespective of the type of gas diffusion layer, when a common electrode was employed, significant performance variations were encountered between current collector segments in the constant voltage mode, while the segment to segment variations were minimal in the constant current mode. Both types of discharge modes showed negligible variations between segments in the case of segmented electrode. A simple mathematical model was developed to assist in the interpretation of the experimental results. The differences in contact resistances between the current collectors and the gas diffusion layer, especially on the cathode side have been identified as the primary reason for the experimentally observed behavior. Based on the results presented here, segmenting the electrode along with the current collector is recommended for current distributionstudies. When using a common electrode, only the galvanostatic mode is preferred to minimize contact artifacts.},

@book{Vielstich03,
	Abstract = {his four volume set brings together for the first time in a single reference work the fundamentals, principles and the current state-of-the-art in fuel cells. Its publication reflects the increasing importance of and the rapidly growing rate of research into alternative, clean sources of energy.
With internationally renowned Editors, International Advisory Board members, and Contributors from academia and industry, it guides the reader from the foundations and fundamental principles through to the latest technology and cutting-edge applications, ensuring a logical, consistent approach to the subject.

The Handbook is divided into three main themes, covered in four volumes:


Volume 1: "Fundamentals and Survey of Systems"
Volume 2: "Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis"
Volumes 3 and 4: "Fuel Cell Technology and Applications"
Volume 1, "Fundamentals and Survey of Systems", provides the necessary backg round information on fuel cells, including the fundamental principles such as the thermodyamics and kinetics of fuel cell reactions, mass and heat transfer in fuel cells, and an overview of the key principles of the most important types of fuel cell, and their related systems and applications.
Volume 2, "Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis", is concerned with the most important basic phenomenon of fuel cell electrodes, electrocatalysis. It includes an introduction to the topic, and a detailed account of the theory. A number of the key practical methods used to study this phenomenon are discussed, as are a number of the key surface reactions. Finally, a number of other related topics associated with energy conversion are discussed.

Volumes 3 and 4, "Fuel Cell Technology and Applications" open with an overview of a range of sustainable energy supplies for fuel cell development. The key issue of fuel storage is considered in detail, before a detailed discussion of the most important types of fuel cells and their applications is presented. Among these, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell systems, alkaline fuel cell modules and systems, phosphoric acid fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells, molten carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells are covered in depth. The use of fuel cells in a range of systems is then considered, including portable systems, propulsion systems and electric utility systems. In addition to domestic and industrial systems, use of fuel cells in such novel environments as the space shuttle and submarines is addressed. Finally, Volume 4 closes with a discussion of the future prospects of fuel cell systems.

Comprising approximately 170 articles by more than 200 contributors, "The Handbook of Fuel Cells: Fundamentals, Technology and Applications", will be an invaluable source of reference for all those working directly in this important and dynamic field, for electrochemists, and for scientists, engineers and policy-makers involved in the quest for clean and sustainable energy sources.},

For water uptake from liquid water, the water uptake depended on the immersion temperature, the ion exchange capacity of the membrane, and the pretreatment of the membrane. The effects of pretreatment were not significant at immersion temperatures higher than 100 to 110 $\,^{\circ}$C. For water uptake from water vapor at 80 $\,^{\circ}$C, the sorption isotherms were similar in shape to those reported by previous investigators for 18.5 to 30 $\,^{\circ}$C, although the water uptake at 80 $\,^{\circ}$C was less than that reported for the lower temperatures.

	Abstract = {Abstract: An adequate understanding of the conductivity of polyperfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes as a function of water content, or relative humidity, and temperature is necessary for an analysis of the functioning of proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Although much work has been done toward elucidating the microstructure and conduction mechanism in PFSA, a satisfactory theoretical model with a minimum of fitted parameters is not yet available. Such a model is developed here for the conduction of protons in hydrated Nafion(R) or like membranes based on the dusty-fluid model for transport and the percolation model for structural aspects. Further, thermodynamics of dissociation of the acid groups in the presence of polar solvents such as water is included. The sorption of solvent from vapor is modeled using a finite-layer Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. With the only fitted parameters employed being the BET constants, determined independently, and the ratio of diffusion coefficients representing the interaction of the protonated solvent molecules with solvent and that with the membrane, the model provides excellent correlation with a variety of experimental data (62 refs.) },

	Abstract = {Abstract: The statistical geometry of the electrochemically active triple-phase boundary in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes with oxygen-ion-conducting (zyrconya type) electrolyte is analyzed by means of an 'effective-medium' theory and verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Variation of the triple-phase boundary with time due to spontaneous sintering of metal particles is described by kinetic effective-medium equations. Their solution reveals possible degradation scenarios, as well as the factors that impede degradation, or even cause a rise of the active triple-phase boundary in the course of SOFC operation. The cermet composition, i.e. the relative portion of electrolyte, metal and pores, is among these factors. It is shown that the 'best' composition before degradation may not be the one that provides the best performance after degradation. The latter depends on the probability of pore opening in sintering of two metal grains. Rough estimates of this probability (and determination of the 'optimum' composition) would be possible from a comparison of the calculated porosity before and after degradation with experimental data, which are not available so far.

	Abstract = {Abstract: A resistor network model is developed for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) composite anodes in which solid electrolyte grains, metal particles, and pores are considered on the same footing. The model is studied by a Monte Carlo simulation on a face-centered cubic lattice, with a random distribution of the three components over the lattice sites. The concept of active bonds is used; the bond between a metal and an electrolyte site is conductive (reaction-active) if the sites belong to clusters connected to the solid-electrolyte membrane or metal current collector, respectively, and if the bond has at least one neighbor site which is a part of a pore cluster connected with the fuel supplying gas channels. Active bonds are characterized by an elementary reaction resistance, inactive bonds are blocking. The total inner resistance of the anode is calculated as a function of composition and the elementary reaction resistance, Rr, vs. ion transport resistance, Re (of a 'bond' between two solid-electrolyte grains). Compositions which provide the lowest inner resistance for a given Rr/Re ratio are revealed. Across-the-sample distribution of the current through the three-phase boundary is investigated. The higher the Rr/Re ratio, the larger areas of the three-phase boundary are used; however, if the ratio is low, the reaction occurs only very close to the anode/membrane interface to avoid ion transport limitations. A scaling law for the reaction penetration depth inside the anode, Nf varies directly as (Rr/Re)? (where ? less than or equal 0.5) is suggested in accordance with the Monte Carlo results. In line with the existing experimental data, the simulation and scaling estimates reveal the interplay between the reaction penetration depth and the anode thickness, which determines the thickness effect on the inner resistance.

More specific situations, including non-monotonic variation, are also revealed, as well as a rare case where the three-phase boundary increases when the sintering leads to the opening of new pores.

	Abstract = {Basically, companies and laboratories implement production methods for their electrodes on the basis of experience, technical capabilities and commercial preferences. But how does one know whether they have ended up with the best possible electrode for the components used? What should be the (i) optimal thickness of the catalyst layer? (ii) relative amounts of electronically conducting component (catalyst, with support - if used), electrolyte and pores? (iii) "particle size distributions" in these mesophases? We may be pleased with our MEAs, but could we make them better? The details of excellently working MEA structures are typically not a subject of open discussion, also hardly anyone in the fuel cell business would like to admit that their electrodes could have been made much better. Therefore, we only rarely find (far from systematic) experimental reports on this most important issue. The message of this paper is to illustrate how strongly the MEA morphology could affect the performance and to pave the way for the development of the theory. Full analysis should address the performance at different current densities, which is possible and is partially shown in this paper, but vital trends can be demonstrated on the linear polarization resistance, the signature of electrode performance. The latter is expressed through the minimum number of key parameters characterizing the processes taking place in the MEA. Model expressions of the percolation theory can then be used to approximate the dependence on these parameters. The effects revealed are dramatic. Of course, the corresponding curves will not be reproduced literally in experiments, since these illustrations use crude expressions inspired by the theory of percolation on a regular lattice, whereas the actual mesoscopic architecture of MEA is much more complicated. However, they give us a flavour of reserves that might be released by smart MEA design. (34 refs.)},

	Abstract = {The cathode catalyst layer (CCL) is the major competitive ground for electrochemical reaction, reactant transport, and water and heat exchange in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). Nevertheless, it is often treated as a thin interface. Its pivotal role in the fuel cell water balance is unexplored. Here, the structural picture of CCLs forms the basis for a novel model that links spatial distributions of processes with water handling capabilities and current voltage performance. In the first step, the statistical theory of random composite media is used to relate composition, porous structure, wetting properties, and partial saturation to effective properties. In the second step, these effective properties are used in a macrohomogeneous model of CCL performance. A set of reasonable simplifications leads to a full analytical solution. Results demonstrate that the CCL acts like a watershed in the fuel cell, regulating the balance of opposite water fluxes toward membrane and cathode outlet. Due to a benign porous structure, the CCL represents the prime component for the conversion of liquid to vapor fluxes in PEFCs. Furthermore, the CCL is highlighted as a critical component in view of excessive flooding that could give rise to limiting current behavior. {\copyright} 2006 The Electrochemical Society.

This work attempts to extend the disciplinary areas in which optimization benefits may be realized through the development and application of advanced optimization strategies capable of handling the challenges associated with complex simulation codes. Toward this goal, a software framework is under development for the application of optimization techniques to broad classes of engineering applications, including those with high computational expense and nonsmooth, nonconvex design space features. Object-oriented software design with C++ has been adopted to provide a flexible, extensible, and robust multidisciplinary toolkit that establishes the protocol for interfacing parameter optimization with computationally intensive simulations. Applications of the software are presented in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, solid mechanics, and structural dynamics. Optimal results are presented along with technical lessons that were learned in the optimization process (27 refs.) },

	Abstract = {Nafion ionomer is impregnated or incorporated in the PEM fuel cell electrodes to achieve high power density. Though many studies have been reported on the effect of Nafion content on electrode performance, best results have been reported at different Nafion loadings by different researchers. Nafion ionomer helps to increase the three-dimensional zone of catalytic activity and platinum utilization in the electrode. It also helps to retain moisture and prevent membrane dehydration especially at high current densities. An optimum Nafion content in the electrode is necessary to achieve high performance. As the platinum loading increases, the electrode thickness and Nafion thickness grows and hence the optimum Nafion content may depend on the platinum loading. In this paper, we have examined the correlation of platinum loading and optimum Nafion content in the electrode. We have found that optimum Nafion requirement depends on the platinum loading and it increases with decrease in Pt loading. For electrodes with 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 mg/cm2 Pt loading, best performance was obtained at about 20, 40 and 50% Nafion ionomer loading, respectively. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The surface chemistry was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and static secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), whereas the topology of the carbon black surface was investigated using low-pressure nitrogen adsorption. All these techniques yield information on the graphitic character of the surface. In general, the electrical conductivity of the conductive blacks increases with the graphitic character of the surface. For low surface area conductive blacks, the electrical conductivity correlates well with the surface chemistry. In the case of the XPS and SIMS data, this correlation is also valid when other types of carbon blacks such as thermal and furnace blacks are included, confirming the determining influence of the carbon black surface chemistry on the electrical conductivity},

	Abstract = {n proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), gas diffusion layers (GDL)
serve as current collectors that allow ready access of fuel and oxidant to the anode
and the cathode catalyst surfaces, respectively. Critical properties of five
commercial and one in-house gas diffusion layers have been characterized and
compared to determine factors limiting the oxygen transport in the cathode gas
diffusion layer where there is no oxygen consumption. These properties are the
limiting current, electronic resistivity, fraction of hydrophobic pores, gas
permeability, pore size distribution, and surface morphology. Polarization curves
using air and neat oxygen were collected to determine the air limiting currents at
three operating conditions: 80{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$C/75%R.H. cathode inlet, 100{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$C/70%R.H. cathode
inlet, and 120{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$C/35%R.H cathode inlet, all at atmospheric pressure. Linear
empirical relationships for permeability coefficient versus limiting current were
found at all three conditions. Characterization of the gas diffusion layers by
porosimetry measurement provides the pore size distribution for the gas diffusion
layers, which helps in understanding the correlation between the permeability
coefficient and the limiting current at the temperatures and relative humidity

	Abstract = {A comprehensive non-isothermal, 3D computational model for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells has been developed, and implemented into a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code. The model allows parallel computing, thus making it practical to perform well-resolved simulations for large computational domains. The model accounts for convective and diffusive transport and allows prediction of the concentration of species. Distributed heat generation associated with the electrochemical reaction in the cathode and anode is included in the model. The model solves for the electric and ionic potentials in the electrodes and membrane, and the local activation overpotential distribution is resolved, rather than assumed uniform, making it possible to predict the local current density distribution more accurately. Maximum current densities are predicted under the land areas as a result of the dominant influence of ohmic losses over concentration losses on the activity at the catalyst layer. A parametric analysis shows that substantially different spatial distributions can be obtained by varying the asymmetry parameter with no noticeable change in the global current density and polarization curve. Changing the conductivity radically alters the current distribution by changing the relative influence of ohmic to activation overpotentials. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

	Abstract = {Partial dehydration of the proton-conducting membrane under working conditions is one of the major problems in low-temperature fuel cell technology. In this paper a model, which accounts for the electro-osmotically induced drag of water from anode to cathode and the counterflow in a hydraulic pressure gradient is proposed. A balance of these flows determines a gradient of water content across the membrane, which causes a decline of the current-voltage performance. Phenomenological transport equations coupled with the capillary pressure isotherm are used, involving the conductivity, permeability, and electro-osmotic drag coefficients dependent on the local water content. The effects of membrane parameters on current-voltage performance are investigated. A universal feature of the obtained current-voltage plots is the existence of a critical current at which the potential drop across the membrane increases dramatically due to the dehydration of membrane layers close to the anode. For a membrane with zero residual conductivity in its dry parts, the critical current is a limiting current. Well below the critical current the effect of dehydration is negligible and the current-voltage plot obeys Ohm's law. The shape of the capillary pressure isotherm determines the nonohmic corrections. A comparison of the results of this study to those of the pertinent diffusion-type models reveals qualitatively different features, the convection model is found to be closer to experimental observations.

The model predicts a net-water-per-proton flux ratio of 0.2 H2O/H+ under typical operating conditions, which is much less than the measured electro-osmotic drag coefficient for a fully hydrated membrane. It also predicts an increase in membrane resistance with increased current density and demonstrates the great advantage of a thinner membrane in alleviating this resistance problem.

In addition to being able to model such phenomena as Schroeder's paradox, the model incorporates other relatively novel features including the effect of temperature on water uptake by the membrane from water vapor, and its associated effects on transport properties. Just as in the physical model, the mathematical model uses the wealth of knowledge contained in the literature to examine and determine values for the relevant transport and membrane parameters.

	Abstract = {A knowledge of the temperature dependence of the electrode-kinetic parameters for oxygen reduction at the platinum/proton exchange membrane (PEM) interface and of mass-transport parameters of oxygen in the PEM is of vital importance in analyzing the performance of proton exchange-membrane fuel cells. The microelectrode technique which was previously developed to determine these parameters at the platinum/Nafion(R) interface at 25$\,^{\circ}$C was used in the present investigation at the same electrode/electrolyte interface. This study was carried out in the temperature range of 30-80$\,^{\circ}$C and at 5 atm of oxygen pressure. The results showed a linear increase of the Tafel slope with temperature in the low current density region, but the Tafel slope was found to be independent of temperature in the high current density region. The values of the activation energy for oxygen reduction at the platinum/Nafion(R) interface are nearly the same as those obtained at the platinum/trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TFMSA) interface but less than values obtained at the Pt/H3PO4 and Pt/HClO4 interfaces. The diffusion coefficient of oxygen in Nafion increases with temperature while its solubility decreases with temperature. These parameters also depend on the water content of the membrane. The conductivity of the membrane increases with temperature until it reaches a plateau at a temperature of 80$\,^{\circ}$C; the dependence of the conductivity on temperature was correlated with the variation of water content of Nafion with temperature},

	Abstract = {The theoretical analysis of mass-transport phenomena at the
             cathode in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is a consequence
             of the experimental analysis, reported in Part I of this paper. A
             one-dimensional model for the substrate-gas diffusion and active
             layers was assumed to elucidate the contributions to
             mass-transport overpotentials. The results of the theoretical
             analysis show that, first, the higher slope of the pseudo-linear
             region of the potential (E) vs. current density (i) plot with air
             or the gas mixtures (O2/He, O2/Ar, O2/N2), rather than with O2,
             as the cathodic reactant, is predominantly due to mass-transport
             limitations in the active layer; and, second, the departure from
             linearity of the E vs. i plot is due to mass transport in the
             substrate-diffusion layer. Such mass-transport phenomena are
             considerably less with O2/He than with O2/Ar or O2/N2 because of
             the fact that He is a considerably lighter and smaller molecule,
             and the mass-transport parameters for oxygen diffusion are more
             favorable with O2/He than with O2/Ar or O2/N2 gas mixtures. The
             mass-transport limitations in the substrate-gas diffusion layer
             are probably caused by water droplets or films in this layer. By
             altering the Teflon content, porosity and/or thickness of this
             layer, mass-transport overpotentials in this layer could be
             considerably decreased. By increasing the oxygen concentration in
             the gas mixtures to above 40%, mass-transport limitations are
             significantly reduced. Alternatively, increase of pressure from 1
             to 3 or 5 atm, has similar effects. At 1 atm pressure, the
             expected increase in performance with temperature is not observed
             because of the anomalous effect of decrease of oxygen partial
             pressure and enhanced electrode kinetics. (15 refs.) (Author

             mixture as the cathodic reactant, to determine the effects of
             oxygen partial pressure, temperature, and pressure on the
             contributions to activation and mass-transport overpotentials;
             and (ii) a theoretical analysis of oxygen reduction to: first,
             interpret the experimental results with O2/He, O2/Ar, and O2/N2

             physicochemical parameters of the reactant gas, as well as of
             temperature and pressure, on the oxygen electrode potential vs.
             current density behavior. For the experimental analysis, which is
             presented in this Part of the paper, the performance evaluation
             of PEMFCs (in single cells with the geometric area of the
             electrodes being 50 cm2) was carried out using O2/He, O2/Ar, and
             O2/N2 gas mixtures as the cathodic reactants. Experiments were
             also carried out using air and oxygen. Cell potential vs. current
             density measurements were made over the temperature range of 50
             to 90 $\,^{\circ}$C and pressure range of 1 to 5 atm. These studies showed
             that mass-transfer limitations are less in PEMFCs with O2/He,
             than with O2/Ar or O2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, at an oxygen
             composition greater than 40% of O2 in the gas mixture, the
             pseudo-linear region of the potential vs. current density plot is
             extended at least up to 1 A/cm2. With air as the cathodic
             reactant, mass-transport effects are minimal at pressures of 3
             atm and higher. Temperature effects are less significant than
             pressure effects, because in the former case there is a
             compensating effect of higher temperature and lower partial
             pressure of oxygen on the electrode kinetics of oxygen reduction.

             accounts for species transport, electrochemical kinetics, energy
             transport, current distribution, and water uptake and release in
             the catalyst layer. The governing differential equations are
             solved over a single computational domain, which consists of a
             gas channel, gas diffusion layer, and catalyst layer for both the
             anode and cathode sides of the cell as well as the solid polymer

             agglomerate geometry, which requires water species to exist in
             both dissolved and gaseous forms simultaneously. Data related to
             catalyst morphology, which was required by the model, was
             obtained via a microscopic analysis of a commercially available

             electrolyte fuel cell has been developed. The existence of gas
             channels in the current collector is taken into account. The
             model is based on continuity equations for concentrations of the
             gases and Poisson's equations for potentials of membrane and
             carbon phase, coupled by Tafel relation for reaction kinetics.
             Stefan-Maxwell and Knudsen diffusion of gases are taken into
             account. The simulations were performed for high and low values
             of carbon phase conductivity. The results revealed (i) for a low
             value of carbon phase conductivity, a `dead zone' in the active
             layer in front of the gas channel is formed, where the reaction
             rate is small. One may remove catalyst from this zone without
             significant loss in cell performance. (ii) For a high carbon
             phase conductivity value, such a zone is absent, but removal of
             the catalyst from the same part of the active layer forces the
             reaction to proceed more rapidly in the remaining parts, with
             only marginal losses in performance. This conclusion is valid for
             high diffusivity of oxygen. For low diffusivity, dead zones are
             formed in front of the current collector, so that catalyst can be
             removed from these zones. The results, thus, show the
             possibilities for a considerable reduction of the amount of
             catalyst. (14 refs.) (Author abstract)},

             phase change and heat transfer, and includes the gas-diffusion
             layers (GDL) and gas flow channels for both anode and cathode, as
             well as a cooling channel. Transport of liquid water inside the
             gas-diffusion layers is modeled using viscous forces and
             capillary pressure terms. The physics of phase change is
             accounted for by prescribing local evaporation as a function of
             the undersaturation and liquid water concentration. Simulations
             have been performed for fully humidified gases entering the cell.
             The results show that different competing mechanisms lead to
             phase change at both anode and cathode sides of the fuel cell.
             The predicted amount of liquid water depends strongly on the
             prescribed material properties, particularly the hydraulic
             permeability of the GDL. Analysis of the simulations at a current

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional, steady-state mathematical model is
             described to investigate the fluid flow, species transport and
             electrochemical reaction in the PEM fuel cells with conventional
             and interdigitated flow fields. The multidimensional
             characteristics of flow, species and current distributions are
             computed by method based on volume-control finite-discrete
             technique. After comparing the absolute value of convective and
             diffusion component of oxygen flux quantitatively, we found that
             forced convection transport mechanism is dominant for the
             interdigitated flow field design, however the diffusion transport
             is dominant for the conventional flow field design. The
             performance and the pressure loss of these two different designs
             are calculated and compared; results show that interdigitated
             flow field design have better performance for its advantage in
             mass-transport ability, however have larger pressure loss for its
             flow through the electrode. Finally, experimental results
             reported in the literature and predicted polarization curves are
             compared to evaluate the numerical model employed.},
