	/**
	* \brief This class is to be used as a wrapper for the functions needed in the DAESolver
	*
	* All the functions defined within this class are pure and therefore must be reimplemented
	* 	in a derived class.  The functions here are define a Differential Algebraic Equation,
	* 	more specifically in this case, a system of ODE's.
	*
	* The derived classes must have the specific implementation of the functions and
	* 	static wrapper functions that point to the implementation.  This is so that
	* 	the DAESolver can be used in a generic form and interface with COLDAE.
	*
	* The static wrapper functions should take the form:
	*
	* 	\code static void fsub_wrapper (double &, double [], double [], double [])
	* 			DerivedClass *ptr_to_class = (DerivedClass*) ptr_DAE_object;
	*			ptr_to_class->fsub(x, z, y, f);
	*	\endcode
	*
	* 	where ptr_DAE_object is a void globally defined variable that can take any form.
	* 	This must be used with caution.
	*
