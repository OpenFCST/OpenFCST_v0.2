         * The mesh as well as the dof handler may be created by this class,
         * which is the default, or they may be provided by another object, in
         * which case they must be specified in the constructor.
         *
         * Note that in this class the received or created dof handler is associated
         * to the finite element given by the argument "Element" on the parameter
         * file. Therefore, this class in not responsible to generate the system of equations to
         * be solved, only to initialize the dof handler.
         *
         * Element can either be a single element or a FESystem. In the latter case, the
         * nomenclature used in the paramter file is:
         *
         * set Element = FESystem[element1_type(element1_degree)^number_of_elements1-...-elementN_type(elementN_degree)^number_of_elementsN]

         * calculations expensive. All FEVectors should be PETScWrappers::BlockVector so that only a part of the solution is stored. Once
         * we do this data_out and transfer_solution_to_coarse_mesh will have to change as solution will not store everything. (Priority: low)

             * By mapping we mean the transformation between the unit cell (i.e. the unit line, square, or cube) to the cells in real space.
             * Before we have implicitly used linear or d-linear mappings and have not noticed this at all, since this is what happens if we do not do anything special.
             * However, if the domain has curved boundaries, there are cases where the piecewise linear approximation of the boundary (i.e. by straight line segments) is not sufficient,
             * and we may want that the computational domain is an approximation to the real domain using curved boundaries as well.
             *
             * If the boundary approximation uses piecewise quadratic parabolas to approximate the true boundary,
             * then we say that this is a quadratic or \f$ Q_2 \f$ approximation.
             * If we use piecewise graphs of cubic polynomials, then this is a \f$ Q_3 \f$ approximation, and so on.
             *
             * For some differential equations, it is known that piecewise linear approximations of the boundary, i.e. \f$ Q_1 \f$ mappings, are not sufficient
             * if the boundary of the domain is curved.
             * Examples are the biharmonic equation using \f$ C_1 \f$ elements,
             * or the Euler equation on domains with curved reflective boundaries.
             * In these cases, it is necessary to compute the integrals using a higher order mapping.
             * The reason, of course, is that if we do not use a higher order mapping,
             * the order of approximation of the boundary dominates the order of convergence of the entire numerical scheme,
             * irrespective of the order of convergence of the discretization in the interior of the domain.
