   \authors The tutorial was developed by Michael Moore and Marc Secanell and later updated by M. Bhaiya, P. Mangal, M. Sabharwal, J. Zhou and A. Kosakian.
   
   <a name="Introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
   
   This tutorial describes how to develop an application using openFCST. The basic building blocks for creating
   a fuel cell mathematical model in openFCST are explained using AppCathode application as the template. 
   \n
   
   
   AppCathode class implements the polymer electrolyte fuel cell cathode mathematical model proposed in the following publication:
   @htmlonly
   <ul>
      <li> M. Secanell et al. "Numerical Optimization of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Cathode Electrodes", 
   Electrochimica Acta, 52(7):2668-2682, February 2007. </li>
   </ul>
   @endhtmlonly
   The data files used to reproduce the results from the publication can be found in folder: 
   /data/articles/Secanell_EA07_Numerical_Optimization_PEMFC_Cathode_Electrodes.
   There are several subfolders for analysis, parametric studies and design cases.
   \n \n
   The mathematical model implemented is steady-state, isobaric and isothermal.
   Oxygen transport is assumed to be diffusion dominated and therefore is represented using Ficks Law.
   Electronic and protonic transport are governed by Ohms Law.
   The electrochemical reactions are modelled using Tafel kinetics.
   Gas diffusion layer and catalyst layer are considered isotropic.
   \n \n
   The computational domain is shown in red in the figure below. Due to symmetry of the cell in the vertical direction, 
   the computational domain is reduced to the smaller area encompassed by the red lines by imposing symmetry boundary 
   conditions on the top and bottom boundaries.

   </table>
   \n \n
   The governing equations of the model are written as follows:
   \f[
   R_1(\vec{u}) = \nabla \cdot (c_{total}D^{eff}_{O_2} \nabla x_{O_2} ) = \frac{1}{nF}\nabla\cdot i
   \f]
   \f[
   R_2(\vec{u}) = \nabla \cdot (\sigma^{eff}_{m}\nabla\phi_m) = \nabla \cdot i
   \f]
   \f[
   R_3(\vec{u}) = \nabla \cdot (\sigma^{eff}_{s}\nabla\phi_s) = -\nabla \cdot i
   \f]
   where, for the case of a macro-homogeneous catalyst layer,
   \f[
   \nabla \cdot i = A_v i^{ref}_0 \left( \frac{c_{O_2}} {c^{ref}_{O_2}} \right) \mbox{exp} 
   \left( \frac{-\alpha F}{RT}(\phi_s - \phi_m - E_{th}) \right)
   \f]
   The solution variables are the protonic potential, \f$\phi_m\f$, the electronic potential, 
   \f$\phi_s\f$ and, the oxygen molar fraction \f$x_{O_2}\f$. Note that the source terms due to current production 
   are only in the catalyst layer, while they are zero in the gas diffusion layer.
   \n \n
   The boundary conditions are given by the picture below:

   Note that the membrane potential is set to zero at the CCL/membrane interface and that we control the voltage 
   across the cell using the solid phase potential. 
   \n \n 
   
   The governing equations above are nonlinear. Therefore, a nonlinear solver needs to be used to solve this problem.
   In OpenFCST, we solve the system of equations using a nonlinear Newton solver. Several nonlinear solvers
   are provided within the OpenFCST framework, and therefore we do not need to worry about them. You can
   specify the most appropriate nonlinear solver in the main_app_cathode_analysis.prm file, as follows:
    @code
     set solver name = Newton3ppC   # Linear | NewtonBasic | Newton3ppC | Newton3pp | NewtonLineSearch
    @endcode
   \n
   When solving a nonlinear problem using a Newton method, an initial solution is needed. In OpenFCST, we
   choose to solve the problem first in a very coarse mesh and then, refine the mesh using a posteriori
   error estimators.  The simulations are intially solved on a relatively coarse grid and it is successively refined after 
   the non-linear system is solved using adaptive refinement. This involves refining the mesh in the areas with 
   the largest error in one of the solution variables between iterations. 
   The routine \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode::estimate estimate \endlink is used to implement the error estimator for 
   each cell in the domain, for this application. An error estimator developed by Kelly et al. is used to choose the cells needing refinement. 
   The number of refinement leves is defined in the parameter file.  
   \n \n
   
   AppCathode and all other applications which you shall develop would need to implemet the linearized form of the governing equations for your problem
   at the element level. Further routines have already been implemented to loop over the cells in the finite element domain
   and create the global stiffness matrix and right hand side. The local matrix and right hand side assembly will be implemented
   in your application in member functions \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode::cell_matrix cell_matrix \endlink and 
   \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode::cell_residual cell_residual \endlink. The global assembly will take place in 
   \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::BlockMatrixApplication::assemble assemble \endlink and 
   \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::DoFApplication::residual residual \endlink functions in FuelCell::ApplicationCore::
   BlockMatrixApplication which is the parent of all applications in OpenFCST. Based on the above explanation, there are
   several "levels" within each simulation. 
   \n \n 
   The highest level is the \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::AdaptiveRefinement adaptive refinement \endlink loop, which will call 
   the Newton solver to solve the non-linear application and then refine the mesh according to the Kelly Error
   Estimator (provided by <a href="http://www.dealii.org" target="_blank">deal.II</a>). Again, the number of refinement loops is chosen by the user. 
   \n \n
   
   The call to the adaptive refinement is made in the \link SimulatorBuilder simulator builder \endlink class.
   This class is used to set up the simulation at a very high level. It is used to choose a number of key 
   variables which are specified in the main parameter file: the application, solver (there are
   three Newton solvers with a different line search methods) and the solver method (only adaptive refinement is 
   currently implemented). The simulator builder will also define whether we wish to use Dakota to run an
   optimisation case or parametric study and is where the parameter file with the fuel cell properties, solver 
   properties is selected. Note that to chose the application, solver and solver method, the 
   simulator builder will call the \link SimulationSelector simulation selector \endlink class. This class will 
   read the main parameter file and will compare the inputs to a list. If a new application or solver is 
   implemented, it will have to be added to this list. Finally, the call to the simulator builder class is made 
   from the main file. 
   \n \n
   
   The next level is a nonlinear application solver which is implemented in the
   \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::newtonBase Newton \endlink solver classes in FCST. The structure on which these classes are 
   based is contained through the \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::ApplicationWrapper ApplicationWrapper \endlink class.
   This will ask the application to solve the linear system, will update the solution according to the chosen 
   line search and repeat until the residual meets the chosen tolerance. 
   \n \n
   
   At the lowest level is the system of linearized equations. AppCathode and all other applications are responsible 
   for creating this system of linearized equations and solving it. The Newton solver uses this information to solve the 
   nonlinear problem. The linearization of the governing equations above is given by
   \f[
   -\frac{\partial R_i(\vec{u}^{n-1})}{\partial u_j} (-\delta \vec{u}_j) = -R_i(\vec{u}^{n-1})
   \f]
   where \f$ n \f$ is the Newton step. The equations are discretised using finite elements and solved using the Galerkin formulation. 
   The solution is updated and the system is solved again until the desired residual is achieved. This is represented graphically 
   below:
   <TABLE WIDTH="20%" ALIGN="center">
    <tr>
      <td ALIGN="center">
        @image html tutorial_pic_newton.png
      </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   \n \n
    
   The task of the AppCathode is to create the linearized system of equations above, discretise it and solve it. 
   AppCathode inherits from FuelCell::ApplicationCore::BlockMatrixApplication. The latter implements a loop over all elements of the
   computational domain. Therefore, only the local (element level) assembly of the
   weak form of the governing equations is required. The global system is obtained using routines already implemented.
   A system matrix is assembled and then it is solved. The equations are stored in OpenFCST, which therefore provides the 
   coefficients for the matrix and RHS. ApplicationCore provides the data structure for the application (through the 
   BlocMatrixApplication and DoFApplication classes) and the functions to do the assembly. deal.II provides the 
   information about the mesh, the nodes and the finite elements, as well as the solvers for the linear system.
   \n \n        
   
   In summary, creating and running a simulation in OpenFCST will consist of creating an application that uses various FCST classes 
   to build a system of local (element level) linear equations that characterizes the fuel cell and solve the global system. 
   These equations are then used by our already implemented routines to assemble the global system (for the whole mesh) and solve the
   nonlinear problem using a Newton solver. Finally, to increase accuracy, the problem is solved in different mesh refinements.
   \n \n  
   The loops are represented graphically in the figure below:
   <TABLE WIDTH="20%" ALIGN="center">

      <td ALIGN="center">

   </tr>
   </table>
   
   The linear application contained in the application classes of FCST is represented by the green box, while the 
   Newton solver loop is the blue box. Finally the red represents the adaptive refinement loop. Note that in 
   the flow chart above, the optimisation package implemented in Dakota is not included as it is beyond the scope 
   of this tutorial. 
   \n \n
   
   To use the FCST code to create new simulations, the user should only need to create a new linear application. The 
   code is built so that the user should not need to know the deal.II or ApplicationCore libraries in depth, indeed 
   knowledge of the implementation of the Newton solver or the adaptive refinement (both of which are implemented
   in FCST) is not crucial. A new simulation can be created and run by simply creating a new application so with this in mind 
   the tutorial will start with the header file of an example application, AppCathode, and will explain at a 
   basic level all the components that are required to build the application by examining each line of code in 
   sequence. Then the source file will be examined and provide more depth to the explanation given in the header 
   file.
   \n \n 
   
   The simulations are defined using parameter files, simple text files with a .prm file extension that can be read by the FCST 
   code (Note that some parameters can be defined using default values in the code itself, in the 
   \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode::declare_parameters declare_parameters \endlink
   function). 
   \n \n  
   In order to run the simulation, do the following:
   @htmlonly
   <ul>
    <li> Go to folder /data/cathode//Secanell_EA07_Numerical_Optimization_PEMFC_Cathode_Electrodes/analysis </li>
    <li> In the command terminal type:  $../../../../bin/fuel_cell-2d.bin main_app_cathode_analysis.prm </li>
   </ul>
   @endhtmlonly
   The program will run and return the appropriate results. The main and data parameter files will be explained in the
   following subsections.
   
   The application can be used to solve a cathode with and without an MPL by changing the parameters in the 
   data_app_cathode_parametric.prm file.
   \n 
   The model can also be used to solve an agglomerate catalyst layer model. The governing equations are similar to the
   ones outlined above, however, the volumetric current density source, i.e. \f$ \nabla \cdot i \f$, is obtained as
   specified in the following article:
   <ul>
      <li>M. Secanell, K. Karan, A. Suleman and N. Djilali, "Multi-Variable Optimization of PEMFC Cathodes using 
   an Agglomerate Model ", Electrochimica Acta, 52(22):6318-6337, 2007.</li>
   </ul>
   How to modify the parameter file to solve these additional cases will be explained in section 
   <a href="#parameter_file" class=bold>The parameter file</a>.
   \n \n
  
   A number of different libraries are involved in the simulation, first being the 
   <a href="http://www.dealii.org">deal.II libraries</a>.
   These libraries provide the finite elements and linear solvers required to solve the problem. Next are the ApplicationCore 
   libraries that actually assemble the system of equations and form the basis of the applications that are 
   created in FCST. Finally, the <a href="http://dakota.sandia.gov/index.html">Dakota libraries</a> are used to run optimisation studies
   and parametric studies. 
   \n \n
  
   <a name="CommProg"></a>
   <h1> The commented program</h1>
   
   
   <a name="Includefiles"></a> 
   <h2>The include file</h2>
   Here, we will step through the include file, app_cathode.h, and explain each line of code.
   
   The first step is to set the compiler flag that defines this file as the app_cathode class
    @code
    #ifndef _FCST_APPLICATION_APP_CATHODE_H_
    #define _FCST_APPLICATION_APP_CATHODE_H_
    @endcode
   
   Next we include all the necessary header files, starting with the libraries that form
   the very core of the simulation, the deal.II libraries. 
   Then the ApplicationCore libraries, which are the basis of 
   the applications used in the FCST code. Finally, we will look at the fuel cell specific FCST libraries.
   
   <a name="dealii"></a> 
   <h3>deal.II</h3>
   
   The deal.II library includes boost as one of its contributing libraries. Here we use the 
   boost shared_pointers instead of C++ pointers because they are more robust in terms of memory leaks.
   @code
   #include "boost/shared_ptr.hpp"
   @endcode
   
   <a name="FCST"></a> 
   <h3>FCST</h3>
   
   The FCST classes are those that are specific to the generation of a fuel cell simulation. The first is 
   geometry class used to store geometry and grid information.
    @code
    #include "grid/geometry.h"
    @endcode
   
   Next are a base class for all applications that provide optimization information and the system management
   class that contains all the equations, variable names used in FCST, and also used for coupling the equations.
   Depending on the simulations, relevant equations and variables are accessed.
    @code
    #include "optimization_block_matrix_application.h"
    #include "system_management.h"
    @endcode
   
   The operating conditions class defines variables such as the 
   operating temperature of the cell, the pressure at the cathode or the molar fraction of hydrogen at the anode
    @code
    #include "utils/operating_conditions.h"
    @endcode
   
   Next are two classes that describe the gases used in the fuel cell and how they interact. The first
   contains the properties about a number of different gases, for example, the viscosity of oxygen or 
   critical temperature of nitrogen. Also described are hydrogen and water vapour. The second 
   describes their interaction. The class will take two gases and return the diffusion coefficient 
   according to Chapman Enskog theory for gas diffusion and Wilke Chang or Hans Bartels Interpolation for 
   liquid diffusion.
    @code
    #include "materials/PureGas.h"
    #include "materials/GasMixture.h"
    @endcode
   
   The following three classes are used to store information about catalyst, electrolyte, and catalyst 
   support. Here we select Platinum, Nafion, and Carbon black, respectively.
    @code
    #include "materials/platinum.h"
    #include "materials/nafion.h"
    #include "materials/carbon.h"
    @endcode
   
   A fuel cell is made of many composite materials for which effective properties need to be obtained.
   OpenFCST contains a library of layers for fuel cells under namespace Layers. The layers
   are made of different materials and are used to compute the coefficients for the governing
   equations implemented in the classes above. Layer classes will return information about the effective 
   transport properties of species through each layer, e.g. oxygen diffusion, protonic conductivity, 
   permeabilities etc. The catalyst layers also provide the interface to the kinetics class, which
   handle the electrochemical reactions in the cell.
    @code
    #include "layers/gas_diffusion_layer.h"
    #include "layers/micro_porous_layer.h"
    #include "layers/catalyst_layer.h"
    @endcode
   
   OpenFCST contains classes that implement the weak form of many partial differential equations that
   govern the physical processes in a fuel cell. For example, classes exist to implement
   the weak form of Fick's law of diffusion, Ohm's law, the Navier-Stoke equations, etc. All of
   these classes are stored inside the Equation namespace in FCST.
   \n
   In our application, we need Fick's law, Ohm's law for that electron and protons and 
   a source term for the electrochemical reaction. These objects are included
   in our application here.
    @code
    #include "equations/new_ficks_transport_equation.h"
    #include "equations/electron_transport_equation.h"
    #include "equations/proton_transport_equation.h"
    #include "equations/reaction_source_terms.h"
    @endcode
  
   The next file contains SparseDirectUMFPACK, GMRES, and Schur complement based linear solvers. It also includes ILU preconditioner.
    @code
    #include "solvers/linear_solvers.h"
    @endcode
   
   The next file declares postprocessing namespace with classes used to evaluate current density, 
   oxygen coverages, and relative humidity at each DoF point of the finite element mesh.
    @code
    #include "postprocessing/data_out.h"
    @endcode
   
   Finally, we include the classes used for evaluating current density at catalyst layer.
    @code
    #include "postprocessing/response_current_density.h"
    @endcode
   
   Because OpenFCST code relies heavily on the deal.II libraries, the deal.II namespace is used in most 
   of the header files.  The ApplicationCore namespace contains a number of basic classes in OpenFCST like 
   application_base which is the parent class of the application_wrapper and dof_application. These save 
   from prefixing all calls to deal.II and ApplicationCore functions and member variables with deal.II and ApplicationCore.
    @code
    using namespace deal.II;
    using namespace FuelCell::ApplicationCore;
    @endcode
   
   <a name="memberfunctiondeclaration"></a> 
   <h3>The Member Function Declaration</h3>
   
   FCST function and member variables use one of the FuelCell namespaces. There are two main namespaces, 
   FuelCell and FuelCellShop. 
   \n
   FuelCellShop is the container for the data classes while FuelCell contains 
   the applications, geometries and intial solutions. The main namespace that is used is the 
   FuelCell::Application, the container for all the applications that have been developed for the FCST 
   code. 
   
    @code
    namespace FuelCell
    {
    @endcode
   
   Application namespace is used for all applications, i.e. all the routines that implement
   the linear system to be solved using a Newton solver.
   
    @code  
    namespace Application
    {
    @endcode
  
    For any application, the first that needs to be declared is a constructor and a destructor.
    When creating an application, the constructor will create an object of type application data 
   (FuelCell::ApplicationCore::ApplicationData). This is a structure that will handle the general data for the application.
  
    @code 
    AppCathode ( boost::shared_ptr<FuelCell::ApplicationCore::ApplicationData> data =
               boost::shared_ptr<FuelCell::ApplicationCore::ApplicationData> () );
    @endcode
  
   The class destructor will delete any pointers that have not been used by the class. 
    @code
    ~AppCathode();
    @endcode
   
   All applications have a delcare_parameters function. This function is used to specify the data
   that is expected from the input file and default data to be used in case the input file does not
   contain any information for that variable. The data is stored in the ParameterHandler object which
   is an object in the nonlinear application.
    @code
    virtual void declare_parameters ( ParameterHandler& param );
    @endcode
            
   
   All applications have a routine initialize. This routine is used to read from ParameterHandler object
   the values for all the data necessary to setup the application problem to be solved. Note that
   declare_parameters simply specifies the values that will be read from file. In initialize, the values
   from the input file are actually read and stored inside the application for later use. 
    @code            
    virtual void initialize ( ParameterHandler& param );
    @endcode
   
   Then we form initial guess for the nonlinear problem along with appropriate boundary conditions.
    @code
    virtual void initialize_solution (FEVector& initial_guess,
                                                std::shared_ptr<Function<dim> > initial_function = std::shared_ptr<Function<dim> >());
    @endcode
   
   All applications need a member function, cell_matrix, that generates the element wise finite element matrix for the 
   system of equations that is solved. Here we loop over the quadrature
   points and over degrees of freedom in order to compute the matrix for the cell
   This routine depends on the problem at hand and is called by assemble() in DoF_Handler
   class
   The matrix to be assembled in our case is of the form:
   \f[ 
         \begin{array}{l}
         M(i,j).block(0) = \int_{\Omega} a \nabla \phi_i \nabla \phi_j d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_0}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
         M(i,j).block(1) = \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
         M(i,j).block(2) = \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_2}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega
         \end{array}
       \f]
   This matrix will be assembled using Equation objects as discussed later.
   
    @code
    virtual void cell_matrix(MatrixVector&                                 cell_matrices,
                                       const typename DoFApplication<dim>::CellInfo& cell_info);
    
    @endcode
   
   All application need a member function, cell_residual, that generates the element wise finite element right hand side for the 
   system of equations that is solved. Integration of the rhs of the equations. Here we loop over the quadrature
   points and over degrees of freedom in order to compute the right
   hand side for each cell
   This routine depends on the problem at hand and is called by residual() in DoF_Handler
   class. Note that this function is called residual because in the case of nonlinear systems
   the rhs is equivalent to the residual
    @code
    virtual void cell_residual(FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVector&          cell_res,
                                         const typename DoFApplication<dim>::CellInfo& cell_info);
    @endcode
   
   If Dirichlet boundary conditions need to be applied to the problem, the application will have to
   implement this member function, i.e. dirichlet_bc. This member function is used to set dirichlet boundary conditions.
   This function is application specific and it only computes the boundary_value
   values that are used to constraint the linear system of equations that is being
   solved
    @code
    virtual void dirichlet_bc ( std::map<unsigned int, double>& boundary_values ) const;
    @endcode
   
   This routine is used to evaluate a functional such as the current density:
    @code
    virtual double evaluate ( const FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVectors& src );
    @endcode
   
   This routine is used to create the output file. A base member function already exists, but in AppCathode we
   will reimplement it so
   that the right labels are outputed and so that I can compute and output the source terms.

   Post-Processing. This routine is used to compute the current density, OH_coverage and O_coverage over

   <h3>The Member Variables</h3>
   In this section we will look at the member variables that are used in this application so the basis of 
   the simulation can be understood. They are usually protected:
    @code 
    protected :
    @endcode
   
   Instead of creating an object, a boost pointer of the base class is used. This is done so that 
   we can select the appropriate child at run-time after checking the input file. This grid object which is
   derived from the \link FuelCellShop::Geometry::GridBase geometries \endlink class. This object defines
   dimensions of the cell, generates a grid for each layer and contains material and boundary ids.
    @code
    boost::shared_ptr< FuelCellShop::Geometry::GridBase<dim> > grid;
    @endcode
   
   The second member variable is the \link FuelCell::OperatingConditions 
   operating conditions \endlink  object that was passed to the initial solution object and explained in more 
   details in the previous section. 
    @code
    FuelCell::OperatingConditions OC;
    @endcode
  
   The cathode contains oxygen as the solute and nitrogen as the solvent, so we need to create an object for each gas
   in order to compute viscosity, density, etc. 
   
    @code
    FuelCellShop::Material::Oxygen solute;
    FuelCellShop::Material::Nitrogen solvent;
    @endcode
   
   Next the cathode gas diffusion layer (CGDL) and cathode catalyst layer (CCL) are created. Again a pointer
   is used to the base class for each type of layer. We will then select the appropriate CGDL / CCL once we
   have read the input file. Using a pointer allows us to code everything independently of the
   layer we want to use. This allows users to develop their own layers. By making them a child of
   the base class, for example FuelCellShop::Layer::GasDiffusionLayer<dim>, the application will run
   for your new layer without any modification. For info on how to create your own layer, please
   consult the documentation on the base layer clases
    @code
    boost::shared_ptr<FuelCellShop::Layer::GasDiffusionLayer<dim> > CGDL;
    boost::shared_ptr<FuelCellShop::Layer::MicroPorousLayer<dim> > CMPL;
    boost::shared_ptr<FuelCellShop::Layer::CatalystLayer<dim> > CCL;
    @endcode
   
   OpenFCST contains a database of materials and layers, but also a database that contains the discrtization
   of most physical equations relavant to fuel cells. Therefore, we will create an object of the 
   physical processes that are relevant to the cathode. For cathode, we need Ohm's law equation for
   electrons, Fick's law equation for oxygen, and Ohm's law equation for protons.
   We also need a source term for the reaction rates.
   
   The equation class used to assemble the cell matrix for Fick's mass transport is
    @code
    FuelCellShop::Equation::NewFicksTransportEquation<dim> ficks_transport_equation;
    @endcode
   The equation class used to assemble the cell matrix for electron transport is
    @code
    FuelCellShop::Equation::ElectronTransportEquation<dim> electron_transport_equation;
    @endcode
   
   Equation class used to assemble the cell matrix for proton transport is
    @code
    FuelCellShop::Equation::ProtonTransportEquation<dim> proton_transport_equation;
    @endcode
   
   The Equation class to assemble the cell matrix and cell_residual for
   the reaction source terms is the object of reaction_source_terms. 
    @code
    FuelCellShop::Equation::ReactionSourceTerms< dim > reaction_source_terms;
    @endcode
   
   The Class of ORRCurrentDensityResponse is used to calculate the ORR current density and coverages 
   (if provided in the kinetic model) by the catalyst layer.Since the surface area and volume of the 
   catalyst layer is not known, the layer return the total current density produced.And the sum of 
   all coverages at the element.After that, we finish the declaration of the class and the namespaces
   in the app_cathode.h file.
    @code
    FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ORRCurrentDensityResponse<dim> ORRCurrent;
      };
     } // Application
    } // FuelCell
    @endcode 
  
   
   <a name="mainapplication"></a>
   <h2>Source File</h2>
   
   
   <a name="memberfunctions"></a> 
   <h3>The Member Functions</h3>
   
   All source files need to include the .h file. Therefore, the first line in our code is
    @code
    #include "app_cathode.h"
    @endcode
   \n
  
   Since all member functions are in namespace  FuelCell::Application, it is useful to define a shortcut.
    @code 
    namespace NAME = FuelCell::Application;
    @endcode
  
   Now, we are ready to start the implementation of all the member functions in AppCathode.
   \n \n
   Each application is based on the application base class in ApplicationCore (FuelCell::ApplicationCore::ApplicationBase), in 
   particular the OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication class (FuelCell::ApplicationCore::OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication).
   This class is the last in a series of inherited classes starting with ApplicationBase that includes
   DoFApplication (FuelCell::ApplicationCore::DoFApplication) and BlockMatrixApplication (FuelCell::ApplicationCore::BlockMatrixApplication).
   The DoFApplication contains a handler for the degrees of freedom, Triangulation and the mesh. 
   BlockMatrixApplication handles the matrices and the assembling of the linear systems of equations.
   OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication was then added by the OpenFCST developers to handle sensitivity analysis. 
   As such all applications are inherited from OptimizationBlockMatrix.
   \n \n
   AppCathode constructor will therefore initialize OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication. Also, all equation
   classes need to be created during the constructor. Finally, we output a line to the terminal stating
   that this application has been created.
    @code
    template<int dim>
    NAME::AppCathode<dim>::AppCathode( boost::shared_ptr< FuelCell::ApplicationCore::ApplicationData > data )
    :
    FuelCell::ApplicationCore::OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication<dim>(data),
    
    ficks_transport_equation(this->system_management, &solute, &solvent),
    electron_transport_equation(this->system_management),
    proton_transport_equation(this->system_management),
    reaction_source_terms(this->system_management),
    ORRCurrent(this->system_management)
    {
      this->repair_diagonal = true;
      FcstUtilities::log << "->FuelCell::Application::AppCathode-" << dim << "D" << std::endl;
    }
    @endcode
   The destructor for AppCathode does not need to remove any extra pointers since boost pointers have
   their own memory management strategy.
    @code 
    //---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   template<int dim>
   NAME::AppCathode<dim>::~AppCathode()
   { }
    @endcode         
   
   Now that the application is created, the next step is to provide the required information to run a 
   simulation. There are three functions that are used to do this. The first is the <code>declare_parameters
   </code> function. The application needs to declare the parameters it needs from file, but all other
   objects used by the applicaiton also need to do the same thing. Therefore, declare_parametes contains
   a call to declare_parameter for all the Materials, Layers and Equation classes. Note that for
   the Layers and Geometry, a static function is called. The name provided in the call, e.g. "Cathode gas diffusion layer",
   is the name of the section in the input file where the information need to be provided. 
   
    @code
    template<int dim>
    void
    NAME::AppCathode<dim>::declare_parameters(ParameterHandler& param)
    {
        OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication<dim>::declare_parameters(param);
    
        // Declare parameters in operating conditions:
        OC.declare_parameters(param);
          
        // Declare layer and material classes:
        solute.declare_parameters(param);
        solvent.declare_parameters(param);
        
        FuelCellShop::Layer::GasDiffusionLayer<dim>::declare_GasDiffusionLayer_parameters("Cathode gas diffusion layer", param);
        FuelCellShop::Layer::MicroPorousLayer<dim>::declare_MicroPorousLayer_parameters("Cathode microporous layer", param);
        FuelCellShop::Layer::CatalystLayer<dim>::declare_CatalystLayer_parameters("Cathode catalyst layer", param);
        
        // Declare equation classes:
        ficks_transport_equation.declare_parameters(param);
        electron_transport_equation.declare_parameters(param);
        proton_transport_equation.declare_parameters(param);
        reaction_source_terms.declare_parameters(param);
        
        // Declare post-processing routines
        ORRCurrent.declare_parameters(param);
    }
    
    @endcode
  
   The initialise function is the final function in setting up the simulation. It actually parses the prm 
   file, extracts the required values and assigns them to the relevant variables. Again the application 
   function calls the functions of the contributing classes.
   \n
   In initialize, the ParameterHandler object param already contains the information from the input file. Now this
   information needs to be distributed to all object in the application. 
   \n
   First, we initialize \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication \endlink,
   operating_conditions (OC), physical properties classes, layer classes, and kinetics parameters in CCL. We also make cell couplings,
   define kinetics, initialize objects that set initial and boundary conditions, allocate memory for the linear system, and initialize post-processing routines.
    @code
    template<int dim>
    void
    NAME::AppCathode<dim>::initialize(ParameterHandler& param)
    {   
        //        
        OptimizationBlockMatrixApplication<dim>::initialize(param);
        
        // Initialize parameters in operating conditions:
        OC.initialize(param);
        
        // Initialize materials and layers:
        solute.initialize(param);
        solvent.initialize(param);
        
        // Initialize gases and material classes:  
        std::vector< FuelCellShop::Material::PureGas* > gases;
        gases.push_back(&solute);
        gases.push_back(&solvent);
        
        // Initialize layer classes:
        CGDL = FuelCellShop::Layer::GasDiffusionLayer<dim>::create_GasDiffusionLayer("Cathode gas diffusion layer", param);
        CGDL->set_gases_and_compute(gases, OC.get_pc_atm(), OC.get_T());
        
        CMPL = FuelCellShop::Layer::MicroPorousLayer<dim>::create_MicroPorousLayer("Cathode microporous layer", param);
        CMPL->set_gases_and_compute(gases, OC.get_pc_atm(), OC.get_T());
        
        CCL  = FuelCellShop::Layer::CatalystLayer<dim>::create_CatalystLayer("Cathode catalyst layer", param);
        CCL->set_gases_and_compute(gases, OC.get_pc_atm(), OC.get_T());
        
        // Initialise the necessary kinetics parameters in CCL.
        const ReactionNames name = ORR;
        CCL->set_reaction_kinetics(name);
        CCL->set_constant_solution(OC.get_pc_Pa(), VariableNames::total_pressure);
        CCL->set_constant_solution(OC.get_T(), VariableNames::temperature_of_REV);
        
        // Setting kinetics in the reaction source terms object.    
        reaction_source_terms.set_cathode_kinetics(CCL->get_kinetics());
        
        // Initialize parameters for physics classes:
        ficks_transport_equation.initialize(param);
        electron_transport_equation.initialize(param);
        proton_transport_equation.initialize(param);
        reaction_source_terms.initialize(param);
            
        // --- second of all we make cell couplings for this problem ---
        std::vector<couplings_map> tmp;
        tmp.push_back( ficks_transport_equation.get_internal_cell_couplings()    );
        tmp.push_back( electron_transport_equation.get_internal_cell_couplings() );
        tmp.push_back( proton_transport_equation.get_internal_cell_couplings()   );
        reaction_source_terms.adjust_internal_cell_couplings(tmp);
        this->system_management.make_cell_couplings(tmp);
        
        // Now, initialize object that are used to setup initial solution and boundary conditions:    
        this->component_materialID_value_maps.push_back( ficks_transport_equation.get_component_materialID_value()    );
        this->component_materialID_value_maps.push_back( electron_transport_equation.get_component_materialID_value() );
        this->component_materialID_value_maps.push_back( proton_transport_equation.get_component_materialID_value()   );
        OC.adjust_initial_solution(this->component_materialID_value_maps, this->mesh_generator);
        
        this->component_boundaryID_value_maps.push_back( ficks_transport_equation.get_component_boundaryID_value() );
        this->component_boundaryID_value_maps.push_back( electron_transport_equation.get_component_boundaryID_value() );
        this->component_boundaryID_value_maps.push_back( proton_transport_equation.get_component_boundaryID_value()   );
        OC.adjust_boundary_conditions(this->component_boundaryID_value_maps, this->mesh_generator);
    }
    @endcode
   
   Let's look closer at this routine. The line
    @code
    std::vector< FuelCellShop::Material::PureGas* > gases;
    @endcode
   creates a vector with all the gases that will exist in the layers.
   
   Each entry of this std::vector reflects the following
   structure (see FuelCell::InitialAndBoundaryData namespace docs):
   - \p first  \p argument : name of the solution component,
   - \p second \p argument : material id,
   - \p third  \p argument : value of the solution component.
    @code
    std::vector< component_materialID_value_map > component_materialID_value_maps; 
    @endcode
   
   Next, we call create_GasDiffusionLayer. This function reads the parameter file section Fuel Cell Data > Cathode gas diffusion layer, reads the type of GDL that we would like to
   use, and then initializes the pointer CGDL to the appropriate GasDiffusionLayer child. In this case, DesignFibrousGDL as we will see when discussing
   the parameter file.
   
    @code
    CGDL = FuelCellShop::Layer::GasDiffusionLayer<dim>::create_GasDiffusionLayer("Cathode gas diffusion layer", param);
    CGDL->set_gases_and_compute(gases, OC.get_pc_atm(), OC.get_T());
    @endcode
   
   Once the layer has been initialized, we "fill" the layer with the gases using CGDL->set_gases_and_compute(gases, OC.get_pc_atm (), OC.get_T()). This routine
   is used to store the gases, the temperature and the pressure in the layer and to compute the diffusion coefficients.
   \n
   MicroPorousLayer and CatalystLayer objects are initialized using the same method.
   
    @code
      CMPL = FuelCellShop::Layer::MicroPorousLayer<dim>::create_MicroPorousLayer("Cathode microporous layer", param);
      CMPL->set_gases_and_compute(gases, OC.get_pc_atm(), OC.get_T());
      
      CCL  = FuelCellShop::Layer::CatalystLayer<dim>::create_CatalystLayer("Cathode catalyst layer", param);
      CCL->set_gases_and_compute(gases, OC.get_pc_atm(), OC.get_T());
    @endcode
   
   For the CatalystLayer object, in addition to specifying the type of gas inside the layer, we also need to specify the 
   reactions that we are interested in solving for since the catalyst layer class contains a kinetics objects which
   will compute the reaction rates for different reactions. In order to compute the reactions, we need to know
   the overpotential, temperature and pressure. Every time we call the cell_matrix and cell_residual function, we pass the solution (which will contain 
   the oxygen molar fraction and the two potentials) to the kinetics class. However the kinetics class expects that 
   the temperature and pressure are solution variables (i.e.that it is set at each quadrature point for each cell).
   \link FuelCellShop::Layer::CatalystLayer<dim>::set_constant_solution(OC.get_pc_Pa(), VariableNames::total_pressure)  \endlink and
   \link FuelCellShop::Layer::CatalystLayer<dim>::set_constant_solution(OC.get_T(), temperature_of_REV) \endlink
   are used to specify that these variables are constant and should take the value provided as the first argument. 
   
    @code
      // Initialise the necessary kinetics parameters in CCL.
      const ReactionNames name = ORR;
      CCL->set_reaction_kinetics(name);
      CCL->set_constant_solution(OC.get_pc_Pa(), VariableNames::total_pressure);
      CCL->set_constant_solution(OC.get_T(), VariableNames::temperature_of_REV);
    @endcode
    
   Once the layers have been initialized, it is time to initialize the Equation objects. 
   \n
   Before initializing the objects, we set the kinetics in the reaction source term object. Next,
   we allow all Equation object to read all their parameters from file:  
    @code
   
       // Setting kinetics in the reaction source terms object.
       reaction_source_terms.set_cathode_kinetics(CCL->get_kinetics());
   
       // Initialize parameters for physics classes:
       electron_transport_equation.initialize(param);  
       proton_transport_equation.initialize(param);  
       ficks_transport_equation.initialize(param);  
       reaction_source_terms.initialize(param);
    @endcode
   
   Next is to prepare the matrix that will contain our system of equations. This involves telling the 
   application how the equations are coupled, i.e. how one solution variable affects the other equations. 
   The blocks for our three equation system are visualised below:
   <TABLE WIDTH="20%" ALIGN="center">
    <tr>
      <td ALIGN="center">
        @image html tutorial_blocks.png
      </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  
   After the coupling step, we initialize objects that are used to set initial and boundary conditions. 
  
   Each equation has its corresponding solution values id in the material since 
   <code>component_materialID_value_maps</code> is a vector. By doing the <code>push_back</code>, we store all the solution name 
   with its corresponding material id and values inside the <code>component_materialID_value_maps</code>. The function
   <code>adjust_initial_solution</code> is used to compute the initial value of of each solution variable inside the material.
  
    @code
      component_materialID_value_maps.push_back( ficks_transport_equation.get_component_materialID_value()    );
      component_materialID_value_maps.push_back( electron_transport_equation.get_component_materialID_value() );
      component_materialID_value_maps.push_back( proton_transport_equation.get_component_materialID_value()   );
      OC.adjust_initial_solution(component_materialID_value_maps, grid);
    @endcode
   
   Same for boundaries:
   
    @code
        this->component_boundaryID_value_maps.push_back( ficks_transport_equation.get_component_boundaryID_value() );
        this->component_boundaryID_value_maps.push_back( electron_transport_equation.get_component_boundaryID_value() );
        this->component_boundaryID_value_maps.push_back( proton_transport_equation.get_component_boundaryID_value()   );
        OC.adjust_boundary_conditions(this->component_boundaryID_value_maps, this->mesh_generator);
    @endcode
   
   The next step is to initialise the matrix that will store the system of equations. 
    @code
    this->remesh_matrices();
    @endcode
   
   To compute other variables like O_coverage or OH_coverage, we need to initialize the post_processing routines.
    @code
      ORRCurrent.initialize(param);
    @endcode
   That is all. You might want to call the following routines that are used to print information to screen
   in order to make sure you have initialized your layers correctly:
    @code
    // Some info for debugging purposes:
      //system_management.print_system_info ();
      CGDL->print_layer_properties();
      CMPL->print_layer_properties();
      CCL->print_layer_properties();
       //abort();
    }
    @endcode
   
   The last part of the setting up the simulation involves providing information about the initial solution
   to the nonlinear solver. This is done with the \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::initialize_solution initialize_solution \endlink
   function. 
    @code
    template<int dim>
    void
    NAME::AppCathode<dim>::initialize_solution(FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVector& initial_guess,
                                               std::shared_ptr<Function<dim> > initial_function)
    {
        DoFApplication<dim>::initialize_solution(initial_guess);    
    }
    @endcode 
  
   \n \n
   The simulation has now been set up so we can start to work on the member functions that are used to assemble the
   local (element-wise) matrix and residual (right hand side). 
   \n \n
   The two most important functions in
   the application are the \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::cell_matrix cell_matrix \endlink and 
   \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::cell_residual cell_residual \endlink  functions. The functions 
   provide the coefficients for the left and right hand side of our linearised system of equations 
   respectively (\f$ \frac{dR(u,p)}{du}(-\delta u) = R(u,p)\f$). 
   \n \n
   We will start with the 
   \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::cell_matrix cell_matrix \endlink function which implements the 
   integration of the local bilinear form. Here we loop over the quadrature points and over degrees of freedom in 
   order to compute the matrix for the cell. This routine depends on the problem at hand and is called in 
   \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::BlockMatrixApplication::assemble assemble \endlink in BlockMatrixApplication class.
   \n \n
    In this case, the matrix to be assembled is given below:
      \f[
	\begin{array}{l}
	
	  M(i,j).block(0)  =  \int_{\Omega} a \nabla \phi_i \nabla \phi_j d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_0}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \quad \qquad \\
	  M(i,j).block(1)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
	  M(i,j).block(2)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_2}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
	  M(i,j).block(3)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_0}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
	  M(i,j).block(4)  =  \int_{\Omega} a \nabla \phi_i \nabla \phi_j d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \quad \qquad \\
	  M(i,j).block(5)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_2}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
	  M(i,j).block(6)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_0}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
	  M(i,j).block(7)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega \\
	  M(i,j).block(8)  =  \int_{\Omega} a \nabla \phi_i \nabla \phi_j d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_2}\Big|_n \phi_j d\Omega
	  
	\end{array}
      \f]
    \n \n
   
   OpenFCST already contains many equation classes which are used to assemble the local cell matrices. Therefore, assembling the matrices is extremely simple. Simply call
   the Equation classes you want to solve!
   \n
   <code>cell_matrix</code> receives a MatrixVector object containing a vector of local matrices corresponding to all the non-zero matrices in the global matrix such that
   cell_matrices[0] corresponds to M(i,j).block(0), and a <code>CellInfo</code> object that

    NAME::AppCathode<dim>::cell_matrix(FuelCell::ApplicationCore::MatrixVector&                                 cell_matrices,
                                         const typename FuelCell::ApplicationCore::DoFApplication<dim>::CellInfo& cell_info)

   In this case, we solve a different set of equations for each layer. In the gas diffusion layer,
   we solve for Fick's law of diffusion and electron transport. Therefore, we can ask our Equation
   classes to assemble the local matrices for GDL cells using the information provided by
   the CGDL class. 
   \n
   A particular layer is identified through its material id for any particular cell. 
   The information of material id is accessed using the member function material_id() in
   the \link FuelCell::ApplicationCore::DoFApplication<dim>::CellInfo info \endlink object. 
   \n
   Equation classes such as <code>ficks_transport_equation</code>, <code>electron_transport_equation</code>,<code> proton_transport_equation</code>
   and <code>reaction_source</code> have an inbuilt function <code>assemble_cell_matrix</code> which assembles the local matrix and passes
   the local matrix to the MatrixVector which is a vector of local matrices, it assembles the local matrices
   and makes them global. The call to <code>assemble_cell_matrix</code> will return M(i,j).block(0) filled based on the
   properties of the cell and the CGDL.
   
    @code
       if(      CGDL->belongs_to_material(cell_info.cell->material_id())   )
       {
           ficks_transport_equation.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CGDL.get());
           electron_transport_equation.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CGDL.get());
       }
    @endcode
   
   The same process can be applied to the MPL:
    @code
       else if( CMPL->belongs_to_material(cell_info.cell->material_id())   )
       {
           ficks_transport_equation.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CMPL.get());
           electron_transport_equation.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CMPL.get());
       }
    @endcode
   
   In the catalyst layer, we want to solve not only for oxygen and electron transport but also for
   proton transport and for the reaction terms. Therefore, all four Equation objects are called in order
   to provide the required information in cell_matrices.
   
    @code
       else if( CCL->belongs_to_material(cell_info.cell->material_id())    )
       {
           ficks_transport_equation.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CCL.get());
           electron_transport_equation.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CCL.get());
           proton_transport_equation.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CCL.get());
           reaction_source_terms.assemble_cell_matrix(cell_matrices, cell_info, CCL.get());
       }
    @endcode
   
   Finally, if the mesh contains cells with a material ID that does not correspond to any of the layers defined in the
   application, we will ask the program to provide an error message:
    @code
       else
       {
          FcstUtilities::log<<"Material id: "    <<cell_info.cell->material_id()<<" does not correspond to any layer"<<std::endl;
          Assert( false , ExcNotImplemented() );
       }
    }
    @endcode
    
   Using the process specified above, local cell matrices are formed for all three layers and equations. 
   \n \n 
   This completes the <code>cell_matrix</code> function. We can now move onto the <code>cell_residual</code> and the 
   right hand side (RHS).
   \n \n 
   The \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::cell_residual cell_residual \endlink function works 
   similarly to the <code>cell_matrix</code> member function. The main difference is that in constructing the RHS we are not 
   assembling a matrix, but a vector, which is why <code>cell_vector</code> is passed in the <code>cell_residual</code> 
   function call. 
   \n
   The vector we are constructing is given by:

   \f[
      \begin{array}{l}
      R(i),block(i) = \int_{\Omega} \phi_j a (\nabla u)^n d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_j f(u^n) d\Omega
      \end{array}
   \f]
   \n
   In our case this can be written as:
   
   \f[
   
   \begin{array}{l}
      R(i),block(0)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_j D_{O_2} (\nabla x_{O_2})^n d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_j \left( \frac{i(u^n)}{4F} \right) d\Omega \\
      R(i),block(1)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_j \sigma_m (\nabla \phi_m)^n d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_j \left( \frac{i(u^n)}{F} \right) d\Omega \\
      R(i),block(2)  =  \int_{\Omega} \phi_j \sigma_s (\nabla \phi_m)^n d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \phi_j \left( \frac{i(u^n)}{-F} \right) d\Omega 
    \end{array}
    
   \f]
   
   where \f$ {u}^n \f$ is the solution at the \f$ n \f$ iteration in the Newton loop.
   \n \n
   <code>cell_residual</code> takes two arguments, a BlockVector that should be initialized to
   the local right hand side, i.e. element-wise right hand side, and a CellInfo object that
   contains information regarding the cell finite element, material id, boundary id and the
   solution at the quadrature points in the cell. This information is used to setup the right hand
   side.
   \n
   As in <code>cell_matrix</code>, we first check at which material the cell belongs to and, based on its
   material id, we use the appropriate Equation class to assemble the right hand side. In this case,
   this is done by calling the member function <code>assemble_cell_residual</code>.
   
    @code
    template<int dim>
    void

          Assert( false , ExcNotImplemented() );
        }
    }
   @endcode
  
   Next, we need to define the boundary conditions for the three solution variables. Note that since we
   are solving a linearized system, the boundary conditions are not for the solution variables
   oxygen mole fraction, electrical and proton potential, but for their variation, i.e. \f$ \delta u \f$ instead
   of \f$ u \f$. Therefore, the variation of each boundary conditon of the nonlinear problem needs to
   be implemented here.
   \n \n 
   
   Dirichlet boundary conditions on the solution variables have a variation of zero, i.e. if the initial
   solution satisfies the boundary conditions, the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the variations are that
   the variation should be zero.
   \n \n
   
   Imposing a zero Dirichlet boundary condition is done by the 
   \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::dirichlet_bc dirichlet_bc \endlink 
   function. This function fills a std::map named boundary_values with an unsigned int
   representing the degree of freedom and the Dirichlet value of the boundary condition. In 
   this case, all Dirichlet boundaries will have a zero value.
   
    @code

   \n \n
   \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::cell_responses cell_responses \endlink function
   is used to calculate the value of all objective functions and constraints which require looping over cells.
    @code
    template<int dim>
    void
    NAME::Application::AppCathode<dim>::cell_responses(std::vector<double>&                                                     dst,
                                            const typename FuelCell::ApplicationCore::DoFApplication<dim>::CellInfo& cell_info,
                                            const FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVector& src)
    {
    @endcode 
   The material id of the active cells or Catalyst Layer (CL) is obtained by querying the <code>dof_active_cell</code> for 
   the <code>material_id</code> property.
    @code
     // -- Find out what material is the cell made of, i.e. MEA layer)
     const unsigned int material_id = cell_info.dof_active_cell->material_id();
    @endcode
   Next we define a map for the response object from <code>PostProcessing</code> class and use it 
   to calculate the ORR Response in the Catalyst Layer by comparing the cells to the CL material id
    @code
    // Compute ORR responses in the CL
    std::map<FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ResponsesNames, double> ORR_responses;
      
    if (CCL->belongs_to_material(material_id)) //the material is the catalyst layer
    {  
        ORRCurrent.compute_responses(cell_info, CCL.get(), ORR_responses);        
    }
    @endcode
   Finally we calculate the geometric properties like length of catalyst (<code>L_cat</code>),
   cross-sectional area of CL (<code>area_CL</code> and volume of the CL (<code>volume_CL</code>).
   Now with these geometric values defined we can normalize our responses like current, OH coverage,
   and Oxygen coverage w.r.t. the CL. Based on the response names defined by the user we calculate 
   one or all of the above.
    @code
    // Organize responses:
    // -- Used to normalize current density (note necessary since it can be done via input file)
    std::vector<double> L_cat_vec = grid->L_cat_c();
    double L_cat = std::accumulate(L_cat_vec.begin(),L_cat_vec.end(),0.0);
    double area_CL = grid->L_channel_c()/2.0 + grid->L_land_c()/2.0;
    double volume_CL = (grid->L_channel_c()/2.0 + grid->L_land_c()/2.0)*L_cat;
      
    for (unsigned int r = 0; r < this->n_resp; ++r)
     {
        if (this->name_responses[r] == "current" && CCL->belongs_to_material(material_id))
            dst[r] += -1*ORR_responses[FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ResponsesNames::ORR_current]/ area_CL;
            //(If using response normalization) resp[r] += ORR_responses[FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ResponsesNames::current];               
        else if (this->name_responses[r] == "OH_coverage" && CCL->belongs_to_material(material_id))
            dst[r] += (1/volume_CL)*ORR_responses[FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ResponsesNames::OH_coverage];
            //(If using response normalization) resp[r] += ORR_responses[FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ResponsesNames::OH_coverage];
        else if (this->name_responses[r] == "O_coverage" && CCL->belongs_to_material(material_id))
            dst[r] += (1/volume_CL)*ORR_responses[FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ResponsesNames::O_coverage];
      }
      
    }
   @endcode
   
   
   \n 
   Next is the \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::global_responses global_responses \endlink function.
   The <code>global_responses</code> function is used when computing the volume fraction of each component inside the cathode
   catalyst layer. In this case, the three constraint components inside the cathode catalyst layer electrolyte loading (Nafion),
   solid phase (carbon fibres) and the void space (empty space) for oxygen transportation.
   @code 
        std::vector<unsigned int> cathode_CL_material_ids;
        std::map<std::string, double> volume_fractions;
        cathode_CL_material_ids = CCL->get_material_ids();
   @endcode
  
   As the name states, the cathode_CL_material_ids is the material id defined in the parameter file which belongs to CCL.
   The volume_fractions is actually a map, the key is the name of the component inside the CCL and the value is the volume fraction corresponding to it.
   cathode_CL_material_ids = CCL->get_material_ids(); is to find the material id and give the values to cathode_CL_material_ids.
   @code 
       for (unsigned int i = 0; i < cathode_CL_material_ids.size(); ++i)
      {
          
          CCL->set_local_material_id(cathode_CL_material_ids[i]);
          CCL->get_volume_fractions(volume_fractions);
          std::string epsilonc = "epsilon_V_cat_c:";
          std::stringstream epsilon_c;
          epsilon_c << epsilonc << cathode_CL_material_ids[i];
          
          std::string epsilons = "epsilon_S_cat_c:";
          std::stringstream epsilon_s;
          epsilon_s << epsilons << cathode_CL_material_ids[i];
         
          std::string epsilonn = "epsilon_N_cat_c:";
          std::stringstream epsilon_n;
          epsilon_n << epsilonn << cathode_CL_material_ids[i];
         
          for (unsigned int r = 0; r < this->n_resp; ++r)
          {
              if (this->name_responses[r].compare(epsilon_c.str()) == 0) {
                  resp[r] = volume_fractions.find("Void")->second;
              }
              else if (this->name_responses[r].compare(epsilon_s.str()) == 0) {
                  resp[r] = volume_fractions.find("Solid")->second;
              }
              else if (this->name_responses[r].compare(epsilon_n.str()) == 0) {
                  resp[r] = volume_fractions.find("Ionomer")->second;
              }
          }
      }
   @endcode
  
   The first loop is looping over the material id and sets local material_id to the actual id it belongs to.
   The volume_fraction is computed directly through the function calling CCL->get_volume_fractions(volume_fractions).
   After that the material id and the the name belongs to it are combined through the std::stringstream epsilon_c, 
   epsilon_c << epsilonc << cathode_CL_material_ids[i]. The epsilon_c contains two parts: name and the id.
   In the second loop, the volume fractions are assigned to the output response correspondingly.
   
   The next function in the postprocessing routines is the \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::evaluate evaluate \endlink function.
   The <code>evaluate</code> function is used when running the optimization problem to evaluate  
   a functional response value.
   The function has a relatively simple definition where it takes the FEVector which is the solution vector and evaluates the response.
    @code 
    template <int dim>
    double
    NAME::AppCathode<dim>::evaluate (const FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVectors& src)
    {
       std::vector<double> test(this->n_resp, 0.0);
       this->responses(test,
                       src);
       return -test[0];
    }
    @endcode
   
   \n 
  
   \link FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim>::data_out data_out \endlink function is used to create 
   the .vtk files that will be used to visualise our 
   solution in Paraview. This member fuction takes a string with the name of the output file
   we would like to create and the FEVectors object with the solution. 
    @code   
    //---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    template <int dim>
    void 
    NAME::AppCathode<dim>::data_out(const std::string &filename, 
                                    const FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVectors &src)
    {             
    @endcode
   
   When calling this function, we pass the name of data we want to print out.
   Once a simulation has run, the code will print out both the grid and the
   solution .vtk files at each refinement level. In data_out, we are creating the vtk files so we pass
   the string "fuel_cell_solution_DataFile_00001_Cycle_" plus the cycle number of the adaptive refinement loop. We also 
   pass the <code>FEVectors</code> object that contains the solution and the residual. 
  
   The following step in the code is to extract the solution vector from the <code>FEVectors</code> object:
    @code
    // --- Find solution ---
    FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVector solution = src.vector( src.find_vector("Solution") );
    @endcode
   
   Next we create a vector of the solution names and then pass it to the data_out function. 
    @code
     // Output solution with its corresponent names:
     std::vector<std::strings> solution_names;
   
     solution_names.push_back("Oxygen_molar_fraction");
     solution_names.push_back("Protonic_electrical_potential");
     solution_names.push_back("Electronic_electrical_potential");
    @endcode
   
   Next we clear all the solution names no matter whether it is a scalar or parts of a vector and 
   resize the solution_interpretations with the number of the blocks and make all the solution names
   to be the scalar.
    @code
     // --- Assign solution interpretations ---
    this->solution_interpretations.clear();
    this->solution_interpretations.resize(this->element->n_blocks(),
                                          DataComponentInterpretation::component_is_scalar);
    @endcode
  
   To do further postprocessing, a vector of the type <code>DataPostprocessor<dim></code> is  created to store all the objects from the namespace of FuelCellShop::PostProcessing.
   The DataPostprocessor is the parent of all the objects in namespace FuelCellShop::PostProcessing.
    @code
      // --- Create vector of PostProcessing objects ---
     std::vector< DataPostprocessor<dim>* > PostProcessing;
    @endcode
   The current density is computed simply by calling the constant function in 
   FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ORRCurrentDensityDataOut<dim> and passing two arguments, one is the system_management
   and the other one is the layer for which the current density needs to be computed.
    @code
     // --- current ---
     FuelCellShop::PostProcessing::ORRCurrentDensityDataOut<dim> current(&this->system_management, CCL, &OC);
     PostProcessing.push_back(&current);
    @endcode
  
   Finally, all the objects (filename, solution, solution_names, and PostProcessing) are passed to the function
   DoFApplication<dim>::data_out to generate .vtk file. If the output option for grid is on then .eps file would be created.
   The type of the file which would be written out depends on the parameter file.
   The <code>data_out</code> function which is a member of the <code>DOFApplication</code>
   and supply the <code>filename</code>,<code>solution</code> vector, <code>solution_names</code> vector and 
   <code>PostProcessing</code> objects as arguments.
    @code
      // --- output ---
    DoFApplication<dim>::data_out( filename,
                                   solution,
                                   solution_names,
                                   PostProcessing);
    @endcode
   This completes the app_cathode application and now we will move onto how to set up the simulations using 
   parameter files. 
   \n \n
   
   <a name="parameter_file"></a><h1>The parameter file</h1>
   When running a simulation, the FCST code requires two parameter files. The first is the main parameter file
   mentioned when discussing the different 'levels' in the FCST code. It is used by SimulatorBuilder to set 
   up the simulation. It contains key parameters such as the application, solver and solver method, and tells
   the simulation if we are using Dakota and the name of the file that contains the physical parameters (among
   other parameters as we will see). The main parameter for the test case developed for app_cathode is 
   given below. Note that these files are located in the examples/cathode/template folder. Please
   note that these files should not be modified and should only
   be run in order to test the code.

    end
    @endcode
   
   As we can see comments in these .prm files are denoted using a # symbol. The structure is the same as was 
   discussed in the <code>declare_parameters</code> function of the application. Note that we are not saying
   what the solver method is. Currently, only adaptive refinement has been implemented so this has been set as
   the default value in the SimulationSelector class. Therefore we do not need to set it in the parameter file. 
   This should always be considered when setting up a simulation, parameters that you do not set will have 
   default values that will be used and there will be no warning if the default is used. 
   \n \n
   
   Now we can move onto the file containing the bulk of the simulation parameters. The file that will be 
   examined is again for the app_cathode test case. It contains physical data about the fuel cell we wish to
   model, including dimensions, operating conditions, properties etc. However it also contains information about
   the grid, the discretisation method, solver information, optimisation and the output. Here, we use the 
   parameter file called "data.prm" from the mentioned folder.

   The first section of the input file details the grid generation. We can select the type of geometry we want, e.g.
   a mesh from file, a cathode or a cathodeMPL. In this case a cathode is used. 
   \n
   
   The Initial refinement states that the initial mesh will be refined twice before the solution starts. Also, Refinement = adaptive
   states that we will be using adaptive refinement to solve the problem. The properties are specified in a subsequent subsection.
   \n
   The next two parameters specify how to organize the degrees of freedom. We usually select to Sort by component. If the Sort Cuthill-McKee parameter is
   set to true then we will use the <a href="http://www.dealii.org/7.0.0/doxygen/deal.II/namespaceDoFRenumbering.html"> Cuthill-McKee </a> 
   algorithm to arrange the degrees of freedom, leading to a system matrix with non-zero terms more localised 
   around the main diagonal. Instead we are using sort by component which will allow use to use the block matrix 
   format. Note that the refinement parameter has a comment after adaptive. This just details
   other options that could be used for this parameter, i.e. we could use global instead of adaptive refinement.
  
    @code
    subsection Grid generation
   
      set Type of mesh = Cathode  # Cathode | CathodeMPL | GridExternal
   
      set Initial refinement = 2
      set Refinement         = adaptive  #global | adaptive
      set Sort Cuthill-McKee = false
      set Sort by component  = true
    @endcode
  
   When selecting a cathode geometry, we let the OpenFCST mesh generator generate the geometry for us. Therefore, we need to specify the dimension of 
   the cell as well as a number id that specifies the material type and the boundary type. The parameters that need to be specified for
   use by the internal mesh generator are given in the following section:
    @code
      subsection Internal mesh generator parameters
        ####
        subsection Dimensions
           set Cathode current collector width [cm] = 0.1
           set Cathode channel width [cm] = 0.1
           set Cathode CL thickness [cm] =  1.0e-3 #1.18e-3
           set Cathode MPL thickness [cm] =  2.0e-3 #1.18e-3
           set Cathode GDL thickness [cm] = 0.01 #10.0e-2 #
        end
        ####
        subsection Material ID
           set Cathode GDL = 2
           set Cathode CL = 4
        end
        ####
        subsection Boundary ID
         set c_CL/Membrane = 1
         set c_BPP/GDL = 2
         set c_Ch/GDL = 3
         set c_GDL/CL = 255
        end
        ####
      end
      ####
    end
    @endcode
  
   Note that Material ID and Boundary IDs are used to relate a layer to a domain in the input file as we will show in the layer section. 
   Note that the symmetric boundaries are given a value of 0 while interior boundaries, such as the one here between 
   the CCL and GDL, must be denoted with 255. 
   \n \n 
  
   Subsection "Initial solution" is self-explanatory.
   
    @code
    subsection Initial Solution
      set Read in initial solution from file = false
      set Output initial solution = false
      set Output solution for transfer = false
    end
    @endcode
   
   Next, we define the parameter for adaptive refinement. Once the grid is created, there
   will be 4 global refinements (Number of Refinements = 4) before any solvers are called. In general, we will always use adaptive 
   refinement in our simulations rather than global, while the number of refinements is the number of times we
   adaptively refine our grid, leading to 5 calls to the Newton solver. Make sure you change "Output final solution" to "true" before running the application.
   
    @code
    subsection Adaptive refinement
      set Number of Refinements = 4
      set Output initial mesh = false
      set Output intermediate solutions = false
      set Output intermediate responses = false
      set Output final solution = false
    end
    @endcode
    
   Next is the information for the Newton solver. Here we set parameters such as the tolerance and the maximum
   number of steps for each iteration. 
  
    @code
    subsection Newton
      set Assemble threshold = 0.0
      set Debug level        = 0
      set Debug residual     = false
      set Debug solution     = false
      set Debug update       = false
      set Max steps          = 100
      set Reduction          = 1.e-20
      set Tolerance          = 1.e-8
    end
    @endcode
   
   Next, we move to the System management section. Here we specify the name of the solution variables and equations. For the cathode problem we have
   three unknowns and three equations as specified.
    @code
    subsection System management
   
     set Number of solution variables = 3
   
     subsection Solution variables
      set Solution variable 1 = oxygen_molar_fraction
      set Solution variable 3 = electronic_electrical_potential
      set Solution variable 2 = protonic_electrical_potential
     end
    
     subsection Equations
      set Equation 1 = Ficks Transport Equation - oxygen
      set Equation 3 = Electron Transport Equation
      set Equation 2 = Proton Transport Equation
     end
   
    end
    @endcode
  
   Next, we specify the initial solution in the material for each solution variable and sepcify the 
   initial boundary condition for each solution variable at different boundary id. This is necessary
   since the map of material id to its value is generated through this way. Otherwise, the code will
   not work.
  
   @code
   subsection Equations
   
    subsection Ficks Transport Equation - oxygen
   
     subsection Initial data
      set oxygen_molar_fraction = 2: 1.0, 4: 1.0
     end
   
     subsection Boundary data
      set oxygen_molar_fraction = 3: 1.0
     end
   
   end
   
   subsection Electron Transport Equation
   
     subsection Initial data
      set electronic_electrical_potential = 2: 0.7, 4: 0.7
     end
   
     subsection Boundary data
      set electronic_electrical_potential = 2: 0.7 # V
     end
   
    end
   
    subsection Proton Transport Equation
   
     subsection Initial data
      set protonic_electrical_potential = 2: 0.0, 4: 0.0
     end
   
     subsection Boundary data
      set protonic_electrical_potential = 1: 0.0 # V
     end
   
   end
   
   end
   @endcode
  
   Next we move to the discretisation parameters. In this section we select the type of finite element and the type of
   quadrature integration. We are using three first order equations,
   however the commented out parameter part shows another potential option, i.e. a third order element for 
   the first equation and two first order elements. To recap on the how the finite elements are set:
   In the test 
   case, we are using three first order elements which are defined using: <code>FESystem[FE_Q(1)^3]</code>.
   If second order elements are required, then we would use: <code>FESystem[FE_Q(2)^3]</code>. To use 
   different elements for an equation, for example, first order for the first equation and second order
   for the two other two, we would write <code>FESystem[FE_Q(1)]-FESystem[FE_Q(2)^2]</code>.
   In the matrix and residual subsections we are setting the order of the quadrature points relative to the
   the degrees of freedom. By setting the value to -1 we are actually saying that the order is one more than
   that of the degrees of freedom.
  
   @code
   subsection Discretization
     set Element = FESystem[FE_Q(1)^3] #FESystem[FE_Q(3)-FE_Q(1)^2] #FESystem[FE_Q(1)^3] #System of three fe
     subsection Matrix
       set Quadrature cell = -1
       set Quadrature face = -1
     end
     subsection Residual
       set Quadrature cell = -1
       set Quadrature face = -1
     end
   end
   @endcode
   
   
   Now we can move onto the physical parameters describing the fuel cell.First, we set the operating conditions for the fuel cell:
   @code
     subsection Operating conditions
        set Adjust initial solution and boundary conditions = true
        set Temperature cell = 353 #[K]
        set Cathode pressure = 101265 #[Pa] (1 atm)
        set Cathode relative humidity = 0.6
        set Voltage cell = 0.7 #828 ## Convergence up to 0.66V
     end
   @endcode
  
   Next we can move onto layer properties. First, let us set up the gas diffusion layer.
   \n
   First, we specify the type of gas diffusion layer we would like to study. There are several types available such as SGL24BA, DummyGDL and DesignFibrousGDL.
   DesignFibrousGDL uses effective medium theories in order to determine the effective diffusivity, and electrical conductivity of the catalyst layer
   based on kinetic theory of gases diffusion coefficients for the gas and bulk properties for the fibers respectively.
   \n
   Once the layer type is defined we select the Material id of the layer. Now, the cells in the mesh with id 2 (Cathode gas diffusion layer) as shown in the
   GridGeneror section, will take the properties of this layer.
   \n
   Finally, we specify the bulk electrical conductivity and the method to obtain effective properties.
   @code
    subsection Fuel cell data
     ####
     subsection Cathode gas diffusion layer
     
       set Gas diffusion layer type = DummyGDL #[ DesignFibrousGDL | DummyGDL | SGL24BA ]
       
       set Material id = 2
       ####
       subsection DummyGDL
           set Oxygen diffusion coefficient, [cm^2/s] = 0.22
           set Electrical conductivity, [S/cm] = 40
       end
       ####   
     end
   @endcode
  
   Next, we define the catalyst layer properties. Again, we set the material id that corresponds to the layer and select
   the appropriate layer. A catalyst layer computes all the effective properties but also the current density in the layer.
   \n
   Here we have three options, a DummyCL which would allow the user to set the effective properties directly, a
   HomogeneousCL and an MultiScaleCL. A homogeneousCL implements a macro-homogeneous model. An MultiScaleCL implements a multi-scale
   model with an agglomerate model (either analytical or numerical) being solved to predict the current density.
   @code
      subsection Cathode catalyst layer
     
       set Material id = 4
   
       set Catalyst layer type = DummyCL   #[ DummyCL | AgglomerateCL | HomogeneousCL ]
   @endcode
  
   Once the catalyst layer has been selected, we need to specify the materials that form the layer. In this case, we need to specify the type of
   catalyst, catalyst support and electrolyte. We select Platinum, Carbon black and Nafion repectively. For each one of the materials, we need
   to specify its properties since this properties are need to obtain effective transport properties and also to predict the current density
   in the layer.
   \n
   Note that the platinum section is used to describe its kinetic properties rather than physical properties. 
   The physical properties, such as density, used are the default values in the platinum class. Again it is 
   important to keep this in mind when creating a prm file. Also note that the reference concentration has been
   modified to include the contribution from Henrys Law. 
   @code
       set Catalyst type = Platinum
       set Catalyst support type = Carbon Black
       set Electrolyte type = Nafion
       
       subsection Materials
         
         subsection Platinum
           set Cathodic transfer coefficient (ORR) = 1 
           #set Method for kinetics parameters (ORR) = Given
           #set Reference exchange current density (ORR) [uA/cm2] = 1.1495E-1        
           #set Reference oxygen concentration (ORR) = 1.2e-6 #(includes henrys) 
         end    
         subsection Carbon Black
         
         end
         subsection Nafion
         
         end
       end
       ##
       ##
       subsection DummyCL
         set Oxygen diffusion coefficient, [cm^2/s] = 4:0.0108934499 
         set Electrical conductivity, [S/cm] = 4:12.00845293 
         set Protonic conductivity, [S/cm] = 4:0.00910831814 
         set Active area [cm^2/cm^3] = 4:341183.43125 
       end 
       ##
       
     end
    end
   @endcode 
   
   Once all the layers are specified, we specify if we would like to compute any functionals at post-processing. In this case,
   we would like to compute the current.
   @code
   subsection Output Variables
     set num_output_vars = 1
     set Output_var_0 = current
   end
   @endcode
   
  
   Finally, we need to set the output parameters for the simulation. In this case we only wish to set the format of the output. 
   The data output is set to .vtu, which can be read
   by Paraview and used to visualise our solution profiles. The grid is outputted in a simple .eps files that 
   can be used to view the grid. However it can't be read by the code and used as a grid in a new simulation. 
   @code
   subsection Output
    subsection Data
       set Output format = vtu #tecplot
     end
     subsection Grid
       set Format = eps
     end
   end
   @endcode
   
   This, along with default values, is enough to describe the fuel cell we wish to model. 
   
   
   <a name="Results"></a><h1>Results</h1>
  
   We can see the results from our simulation in the picture below along with the domain of our simulation. 
   The simulation produces a .vtk file that show the 2D profiles of our three solution variables. 
   We can also produce an image of the source term for each of our equations, i.e. the 
   current production profile. The image shows both the GDL and CCL for the oxygen
   and electronic potential profiles. However because there is no ionomer and no
   current production in the GDL, we have cut out the GDL for the protonic potential and
   source term profiles so as to better visualise the CCL. The CCL is still visible in 
   the oxygen molar fraction profile, on the far left, due to the difference in the 
   oxygen diffusion coefficient between the CCL and the CGDL. Note also that the source 
   term profile is heavily weighted to the upper left. This would indicate a relatively
   slow transport of protons through the membrane. We can also clearly in the oxygen and solid phase potential 
   profiles where the rib and gas channel are. 
   \n \n
  
   The software that is normally used to visualise the results is 
   <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">Paraview</a>, an open source data analysis 
   and visualisation package. An introduction and some exercises are 
   available on the ESDL repository, under the manuals section. Also, the following 
   <a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~bangerth/videos.676.32.html">lecture</a> by
   Wolfgang Bangerth and Timo Heister is also very useful.

   The application can also be used with Dakota to produce a polarization curve. The necessary files for
   producing a polarization curve are given in examples/cathode/polarization_curve.
   Below are the values obtained from a polarization curve study:
   @code
   Cell voltage [V]	Cathode current [A/cm2] 
   0.94	                0.000660393
   0.902222	        0.00228122

   0.6	                3.18371

   This could then be used to produce a polarisation curve.
