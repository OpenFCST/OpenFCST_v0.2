         * 
         * This class implements the interface to compute the properties of a "standard" polymer electrolyte membrane material.
         * 
         * Note that there are many types of polymer electrolye materials such as Nafion, Gore , Flemion membranes etc.. This class serves a common interface for each one of these types. 
         * It implements member functions to declare the parameter file for each catalyst, read the parameter file and select the appropriate
         * polymer electrolyte materials based on the user input. It basically has accessor methods for various physical
         * properties and return bulk transport propeties of the materials. These methods are implemented in the children classes. Since, almost all of 
         * the transport properties are dependent on solution variables, \em e.g. #membrane_water_content, \f$ \lambda \f$, 
         * #temperature_of_REV, \f$ T \f$ etc. Hence it's important to set these solution variables values inside the class, prior to accessing
         * the bulk transport properties, \em e.g. proton conductivity, \f$ \sigma_{H^+} \f$ [\p S/cm], water diffusivity, \f$ D_{\lambda} \f$ [\p cm^2/s], etc.
         * Besides, the derivatives of these transport properties w.r.t various solution variables can also be returned from this class.
