    /**
     * Base class for all classes performing Newton's iteration. Children of this class mainly differ
     * due to the global search method implemented as discussed below.
     *
     * \b Theory
     *
     * Newton's method approximates a value for \f$ \mathbf{x}^∗ ∈ R^n \f$ such that
     * \f[
     * \mathbf{F}(x^∗ ) = 0
     * \f]
     * where \f$ \mathbf{F} \f$ is a system of \f$ n \f$ non-linear equations.
     *
     * The solution \f$ \mathbf{x}^∗ \f$  is iteratively determined by evaluating
     * \f[
     * \mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}_{i−1} + \delta \mathbf{x}
     * \f]
     * where \f$ \mathbf{x}_i \f$ is the ith Newton iterate starting from an initial guess \f$ \mathbf{x}_0 \f$ and
     * \f[
     * \delta \mathbf{x} = - \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_{i−1})}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_{i−1})
     * \f]
     *
     * The matrix
     * \f[
     * \frac{\partial \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_{i−1})}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
     * \f]
     * is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at \f$ \mathbf{x}_{i-1} \f$. Most steady-steady openFCST linear applications compute the Jacobian and solve the
     * linear system above in order to provide the Newton solver with the iteration update, \f$ \delta \mathbf{x} \f$, based on the system of PDEs
     * that the user wants to solve.
     *
     * Newton iterations are performed until the error between the iterate and the final solution is sufficiently small:
     * \f[
     * \| \mathbf{e}_i \| = \| \mathbf{x}^∗ − \mathbf{x}_i \|
     * \f]
     *
     * The error \f$ \mathbf{e}_i \f$ is not known in practice. However, the norm of the
     * residual \f$ \| \mathbf{F(\mathbf{x}_i)} \| \f$ proves to be an effective indicator of the rate of decay of the
     * error. In the case of openFCST, the L2 norm of the residual is used as a termination criteria.
     *
     * openFCST checks if
     * \f[
     * \| \mathbf{F(\mathbf{x}_i)} \| ≤ \tau_a
     * \f]
     * where \f$ \tau_a \f$ is the user-supplied absolute tolerance. If the absolute tolerance is satisfied, the Newton
     * iterations are terminated. This user-supplied parameter is an input parameter specified in "set Tolerance = 1e-5" as
     * discussed below.
     *
     * Further, the user can specify a maximum number of iteration in the Newton subsection of the input file using "set Max steps = 10".
     * In this case, the solver would terminate when the max. number of iterations is reached regardless of the value
     * of the residual, i.e. the nonlinear problem is not solved.
     *
     * A third option for stopping convergence, not used in openFCST, is to terminate when
     * \f[
     * \| \mathbf{F(\mathbf{x}_i)} \| ≤ \tau_r \| \mathbf{F(\mathbf{x}_0)} \|
     * \f]
     * where  \f$ \tau_r \f$ is the user-supplied relative tolerance.
     *
     * Newton’s method should converge to the solution as the number of Newton
     * iterations becomes large. If the initial guess \f$ \mathbf{x}_0 \f$ is poor, however, convergence
     * may fail to occur. Often the failure of convergence is a consequence of the
     * Newton step, \f$ \delta \mathbf{x} \f$, overshooting the correct value of \f$ \mathbf{x}^∗ \f$.
     *
     * The problem of overshooting can usually be solved by using only a fraction
     * of the Newton direction for each Newton iteration; see section 1.6 of [2] for
     * additional details. In other words, a Newton step , \f$ \delta \mathbf{x}^∗ \f$, is applied to each Newton
     * iteration such that
     * \f[
     * \delta \mathbf{x}^∗ = h \delta \mathbf{x}
     * \f]
     * where \f$ h \f$ is known as the step size.
     *
     * The method used to determine \f$ h \f$ is referred to as the global-convergence
     * strategy. The strategy can greatly affect both the efficiency and versatility of
     * Newton’s method.
     *
     * Several Newton solvers have been implemented that implement a different global-convergence
     * strategy. In particular the user has three options:
     * - NewtonBasic: No global-convergence strategy is implemented
     * - NewtonLineSearch: A line search is implemented as a global strategy.
     * - Newton3pp: A three-point parabolic method is implemented as a global-strategy. Two options are possible, with or without prediction
     * of the step size
     *
     * <h3>Usage Details:</h3>

     * FuelCell::Application::AppCathode<dim> app_linear;     // Create a linear application (computes the step size by solving linear problem)
     * FuelCell::ApplicationCore::NewtonBasic(*app_linear);                    // Associate linear problem to nonlinear solver
     * app_linear->init_solution(solution);                   // Initialize solution
     * FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVector solution;                           // Create a vector where solution will be stored
     * FuelCell::ApplicationCore::FEVectors vectors;                           // Pass any other constant data to Newton solver
     * vectors.add_vector(solution,"Solution");
     * FcstUtilities::log << "Solving..." << std::endl;
     * app->solve(solution, vectors);                         // Solve
     * app->data_out(sol_filename,vectors);                   // Output solution

     * <h3> Parameters </h3>
     *
     * The parameters that control all Newton solvers are defined in the subsection Newton in the data input file.
     * The parameters are the following:
     * \code
     * subsection Newton
     *  set Max steps          = 100           # Maximum number of iterations
     *  set Tolerance          = 1.e-8         # Absolute tolerance
     *  set Reduction          = 1.e-20        # Maximum allowed reduction during line search. If the residual is not reduced by at least this number the iteration is discarded.
     *  set Assemble threshold = 0.0           # Used as a threshold to state if the Jacobian needs to be re-evaluated
     *  set Debug level        = 0
     *  set Debug residual     = false         # Would you like the code to output the residual at every Newton iteration?
     *  set Debug solution     = false         # Would you like the code to output the solution at every Newton iteration?
     *  set Debug update       = false
     * end
