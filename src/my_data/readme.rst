 Folder where you can store all your data for simulations

Introduction
========== 

For your own simulations, you will basically need two to three files:

1. main.prm or main.xml file: Specifies the type of application you would like to run, 
  the nonlinear solver you would like to use and the type of analysis, e.g., Analysis (run a
  single point in a polarization curve), Polarization Curve (run a complete polarization curve), 
  Parametric Study (perform a parametric study for one point) and Optimization.

2. data.prm or data.xml file: Specifies all the necessary data to run the simulations

3. opt.prm or opt.xml file: Specifies optimization options (only needed if running an Optimization
  study.
