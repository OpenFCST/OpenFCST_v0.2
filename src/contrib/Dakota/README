Dakota 5.4_R2206 has been modified by OpenFCST developers.

###############
Modification #1
###############
    
The number of backtracks in the OPT++ algorithm should be increased. Before configuring, go to Dakota/packages/OPTPP/src/Base/TOLS.c and change 
"max_backiter = 5" to a minimum of 20. Backtracks will generally not exceed 5-10 but can be greater for optimization in non-linear regions

As well it is suggested that you go into the CMakeLists.txt file in the src folder and copy the following lines
after about line 22:

  # use, i.e. don't skip the full RPATH for the build tree
  SET(CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH  FALSE)

  # when building, don't use the install RPATH already
  # (but later on when installing)
  SET(CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH FALSE) 

  SET(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib")

  # add the automatically determined parts of the RPATH
  # which point to directories outside the build tree to the install RPATH
  SET(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH TRUE)


  # the RPATH to be used when installing, but only if it's not a system directory
  LIST(FIND CMAKE_PLATFORM_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib" isSystemDir)
  IF("${isSystemDir}" STREQUAL "-1")
      SET(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib")
  ENDIF("${isSystemDir}" STREQUAL "-1")

This will help Dakota to be able to link to its own libraries properly.
