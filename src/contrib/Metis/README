Metis 5.1 has been modified by OpenFCST developers.

###############
Modification #1
###############

If you want OpenFCST to install your own downloaded version of Metis then you will 
need to change one line of to prevent errors. In the Makefile on line 67it says: 
       
    make -C $(BUILDDIR) $@ $(MAKEFLAGS); \
  
  change it to:
  
    make -C $(BUILDDIR) $@; \

This issue has been reported to the Metis community and will hopefully be fixed 
in the future, until then you will need to do this to have the OpenFCST CMake 
script install Metis for you.
